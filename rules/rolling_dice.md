# Rolling Dice
The future is uncertain. When a player attacks a monster, nobody can be certain
if they'll hit or if the blade will swing harmlessly through the air. That's
where dice come in. The dice and the numbers that you add to the roll determine
how likely you are to succeed at an action.

Tavern Tales uses a d6, a d8, and 3d20. Optimally, you would also have a d4,
d10, and d12, but the game never explicitly requires them. The number before
the "d" represents how many of that particular die that you need to roll. The
number after the "d" represents how many sides that die has. For example, 3d20
means that you roll three 20-sided dice. 

Ultimately, it's up to the GM to decide when someone needs to roll the dice.
When they call for a roll, follow these steps:

## Step One: The GM Determines What Stat to Roll
Actions are always modified by one of the four stats. It's usually fairly
obvious which stat should apply to the roll. Sometimes, unique circumstances
would allow a player to use an unorthodox stat for a roll. For example, spirit
is the obvious choice if a player is trying to charm someone. But what if a
scholar is trying to win the favors of a love interest by sending him
beautifully crafted love poems? In that case, it might be more appropriate to
use mind because the scholar is relying on their wits.

As a player, you should be creative when you suggest a certain stat to the GM.
The right argument might allow you use your strongest stat instead of your
weakest stat.

As a GM, try to walk a fine a line between lenience and adherence to the rules.
The stat are intentionally left vague so that players can be creative in their
use. If you are too strict, you strangle creativity and out-of-the-box
thinking. If you are too lenient, the stats lose their meaning.

## Step Two: Roll 3d20 and Take the Middle
The person taking the action rolls three 20-sided dice and takes the middle
value. In the following 3d20 rolls, the player would use die result in bold:

* 1, **10**, 20
* 8, **9**, 15
* 8, **12**, 12
* 11, **11**, 11
* 6, **6**, 18
* 2, **3**, 4

The d20 that use you for your final result is known as your primary die. Ignore
the results of the other two d20.

Why roll 3d20 instead of 1d20? Rolling 3d20 has an averaging effect, which
means that you will get 10 and 11 much more often than 1 and 20. This makes
rolls less swingy and more reliable. [This
graph](http://anydice.com/program/43c4) charts the likelihood of each result on
a 3d20 roll.

## Step Three: Add the Appropriate Modifier
Take the bonus or penalty from the appropriate stat and add it to your result.
If you have brawn +3 and roll a 10, your final result is 13 (10 + 3). If you
have spirit -1 and roll an 8, your final result is 7 (8 - 1).

## Step Four: Check for Success
Compare your roll result against the following chart:

|   1-4    |   5-8   |  9-12   |  13-16  |   17-20   |
|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:---------:|
| Very Bad |   Bad   |  Mixed  |  Good   | Very Good |

The chart contains 5 tiers. In general, higher tiers are better than lower
tiers. This means that the better you roll, the better you do. The worse you
roll, the worse you do.

* **Very good:** Your situation tremendously improves. You achieve what you
  were trying to do, and then some.
* **Good:** Your situation improves. You achieve what were you trying to do.
* **Mixed:** You get a mix of good and bad results. Something good happens, but
  something bad happens as well.
* **Bad:** Your situation worsens. Your failure leads to bad consequences.
* **Very bad:** Your situation seriously worsens. You fail spectacularly and
  make things worse.

It's often a good idea for the GM to let players determine the results of their
rolls, even when they roll badly. For example, suppose a player makes an attack
and gets a Mixed result. The GM might tell that the player that the attacker
and the player exchange blows, and it's up to the player to describe how it
happens.

## Should the GM Roll Dice?
In the world of roleplaying games, there are two main styles of gameplay: Multi
Roll and Single Roll. Tavern Tales accommodates both styles of gameplay equally
well, so it's important for your gaming group to agree upon a style.

### Multi Roll
This is the more conventional style of roleplaying games, and is often called
"I go, you go." In this system, the players and the GM both roll dice (hence,
"multiple roll"). The players each have turns, and they roll the dice for their
characters. Similarly, the GM takes turns and rolls dice for non-player
characters and the environment.

This style feels more realistic, tactical, and fair. Consider this game mode if
you want players and non-player characters to feel like they're on the same
playing field.

### Single Roll
This is the newer style of roleplaying games. In this system, the GM never
needs to touch the dice because the players do all of the rolling (hence
"single roll"). Essentially, players roll for both themselves and their
opponents all at once. When a player rolls well, his character triumphs and his
opponents fail. When a player rolls badly, his character fails and his
opponents triumph.

This style feels more abstract and story driven. Consider this game mode if you
want a more cinematic and fluid gaming experience where the players are the
most important.

### Example of Multi Roll vs Single Roll Gameplay

> Dabney (GM): The pirate leans back in his chair with a smug look on his face.
> He grins&ndash;what few teeth he has left are brown and rotten. He says, "I
> don't care a whit that this map is yours. I ain't just gonna give it to you.
> Wouldn't be very pirate-like of me, would it?"
>
> Wesley (Playing as a warrior): We don't have time for this! I scowl at the
> pirate and say, "We bought that map from your boss. Hand it over or I'll
> knock out the rest of your teeth."
>
> Dabney (GM): The pirate throws his head back and laughs. You can smell rum
> (bad rum, at that) on his breath. "You don't scare me, boy. If you want this
> map, you gotta beat me at a game of darts. If you win, you get the map. If
> you lose, the map's mine and you buy me another round of drinks."
>
> Parker (Playing as a rogue): Darts? I got this, guys. "Deal!"
>
> Dabney (GM): The pirate's grin widens, and he stands. It's immediately
> obvious that he isn't as drunk as he appeared to be. He leads you over to an
> old dart set hanging from the back wall of the tavern. "Let's see what you
> got," he says.
>
> Parker (Rogue): Heh, well... here goes nothing. I take it that this is a
> Finesse roll?
> 
> Dabney (GM): Yep.
>
> Parker (Rogue): Alright. I line up my shot and throw my dart at the bulls
> eye. I roll and get a 16!

**At this point, the game's mechanics diverge]**

**Multi Roll**
> Dabney (GM): Not bad! The dart lands pretty close to the bullseye&ndash;just
> an inch or two off. The pirate frowns and roughly shoves you out of the way.
> He says gruffly, "Alright, boy, let me show you how it's done." The pirate
> throws the dart and... not good. He got a 9. The dart hit the dartboard, but
> he wasn't anywhere close to the bullseye.
>
> Parker (Rogue): Ha!
>
> Wesley (Warrior): I face down the pirate and say. "Alright, we won your
> stupid the game. Give us your map.
	
**Single Roll**
> Dabney (GM): Not bad! The dart lands pretty close to the bullseye&ndash;just
> an inch or two off. The pirate frowns and roughly shoves you out of the way.
> He says gruffly, "Alright, boy, let me show you how it's done." Parker, your
> roll was pretty good&ndash;much better than average&ndash;so the pirate has
> some stiff competition. He throws the dart, which lands at the very edge of
> the board.  You beat him by a longshot.
>
> Parker (Rogue): Ha!
>
> Wesley (Warrior): I face down the pirate and say. "Alright, we won your
> stupid the game. Give us your map.

In the Multi Roll example, the pirate and the rogue both rolled separately.
Each actor has a fair chance to succeed, so gameplay feels more even-handed and
realistic. In contrast, the GM did not roll any dice in the Single Roll
example. The rogue's dice roll told the gaming group everything they needed to
know about the dart competition. Because the rogue performed well, the pirate
automatically performed badly. This game mode makes the story feel very
player-centric because everything hinges on the players' choices and rolls.

There are a few other minor differences between these two game styles. The
following chapters explain special rules when these two game styles diverge.

## Increased and Decreased Rolls
Not all rolls are created equal. Throwing a rock and hitting a building is
easy, but throwing a rock and hitting a fly is next to impossible.

Effortless actions that are bound to succeed (throwing a rock and hitting a
building that you're standing right next to) don't require a roll because they
automatically succeed. Impossible actions that are bound to fail (throwing a
rock across a continent) don't require a roll because they automatically fail.

Use the increase/decrease system for easy actions that still have a chance of
failure, or for difficult actions that still have a chance of success.
Increased rolls use the highest d20 instead of the middle d20. Decreased rolls
use the lowest d20 instead of the middle d20. [This
graph](http://anydice.com/program/43c5) charts the likelihood of
increased/decreased 3d20 rolls.

> A marksman is trying to impress his friends with his archery skills. On the
> first shot, he aims for the wall of a nearby building, which is an incredibly
> easy shot. The GM declares that this is an increased roll, so the player
> rolls 3d20 and uses the highest d20.
>
> On his next shot, he aims for a distant bullseye. This shot is somewhat
> difficult, so it's just a normal roll. He rolls 3d20 and takes the middle
> d20.
>
> On his final shot, he aims for an apple on his friend's head. This shot is
> extremely difficult but still possible, so the GM declares that this is a
> decreased roll. The player rolls 3d20 and takes the lowest d20.

Follow these guidelines when you use the increase/decrease system:

* Multiple increases and decreases cancel each other out. If your roll is both
  increased and decreased, then you ignore both effects and you take the middle
  d20. If a roll would be increased twice and decreased once, it is increased
  once.
* The addition of the word "greatly" means that it's two steps instead of one.
  For example, "greatly increase the roll" means that you increase the roll
  twice.
* If a roll is increased twice, treat it as if it is automatically a result of
  20.
* If a roll is decreased twice, treat it as if it is automatically a result of
  1. 
* Increased/decreases rolls don't affect damage.
* For balance reasons, increases/decreases generally shouldn't "jump"
  categories. For example, a player who has the exploration trait "Increase all
  rolls you make to break objects" probably shouldn't get the bonus if they try
  to attack a rampaging golem (combat). The GM decides when to make exceptions.

## Advantage
Having advantage means that you have an edge. The GM might grant you advantage
in certain situations, or you might gain advantage through traits. **When you
have advantage, you can spend 1 advantage to increase 1 of your rolls. You can
only spend 1 advantage per roll.**

Advantage falls into one of the three categories: combat advantage, exploration
advantage, and interaction advantage. Advantage gained through combat can only
be used on combat rolls, advantage gained through exploration can only be used
on exploration rolls, and advantage gained through interaction can only be used
on interaction rolls. Advantage eventually expires depending on the situation.
For example, advantage gained during combat would probably expire after combat
ends.

When the players do something that would logically give them an edge, the GM
might award the players with advantage. Here are a few situations where the GM
might grant advantage to players:

* Combat
  - Before fighting a martial arts master, the players speak to every person
    the master has ever dueled in order to learn more about his fighting
    techniques.
  - A player drinks a special potion, which enhances her combat prowess.
* Exploration
  - Before venturing into a jungle, the players purchase a rare map of the
    region.
  - A player listens to an old man tell dozens of stories about the nearby
    haunted woods.
* Interaction
  - The players proudly wear the King's Insignia as they socialize with a
    lower-ranking noble.
  - A player presents a merchant with an expensive and valuable gift, thereby
    earning the merchant's favor.

Sometimes, the GM will just grant the players advantage by virtue of the fact
that they did something heroic. Other times, they might require the players to
roll for it. A successful roll results in gaining advantage.

## The Difference Between Advantage and Increases
Ultimately, that's up to the GM. This is the general rule of thumb:

* Increase/decrease the roll when the task itself is much easier or harder than
  normal.
* Grant advantage when the players prepare, practice, or use hard-earned
  resources. Players hold onto advantage because they have an ace up your
  sleeve, so to speak, which they can use whenever the situation calls for it.

For example, suppose that a thief is trying to pick locks to access the center
of a castle. If he's picking a very easy lock, the GM might have the thief
increase his roll. If the thief visits the local locksmith and spends several
hours studying locking mechanisms, then the GM might give the thief 1 (or more)
advantage to spend on picking locks.

> A barbarian, wizard, rogue, and bard are preparing to explore a jungle.
>
> The barbarian goes to an arena and watches gladiators fight with jungle
> beasts such as panthers and giant snakes. After studying the beasts fight,
> the GM allows the barbarian to make a mind roll to analyze the beasts'
> fighting styles. Barbarians aren't known for their brains, unfortunately, so
> the barbarian fails her roll and doesn't gain any advantage.
>
> The wizard goes to a nearby library and spends several hours performing
> extensive research about the jungle's wildlife and terrain. At the end of the
> research, the GM tells the wizard to make a mind roll to remember all of the
> information he absorbed. The wizard succeeds and gets 1 exploration advantage
> that he can use while exploring the jungle.
>
> The rogue goes to the local thieves' guild and cashes in a favor. Earlier,
> the rogue helped the thieves' guild get out of trouble with the local
> authorities. He asks for a detailed map of the jungle, which the guild gladly
> provides. The map has 3 exploration advantage&ndash;whoever has the map can
> spend it to increase a roll that relates to exploring the jungle.
>
> Meanwhile, the bard visits a local tavern and chats up a tribal warrior who
> came from the jungle. The bard spends this time talking about the various
> types of people who live in the jungle. The GM has the bard make a spirit
> roll, which she succeeds. The GM says that the bard gains 1 social advantage
> that she can use while in the jungle.
>
> During their travels, the group of adventurers comes upon an old rope bridge,
> which sways dangerously in the breeze. Crossing the bridge should be fairly
> easy, but there is still a chance that one of the players might slip through
> a hole in the swinging bridge and fall into the chasm below. The GM allows
> the players to increase their rolls to cross the bridge.
>
> Later, they come upon whitewater rapids. Crossing the river could prove very
> dangerous. Swimming across the river would be an excellent opportunity for
> the better-prepared adventurers to spend their exploration advantage.

## Group Advantage
Group advantage is the same as advantage, except that any of your allies who
are present can use your group advantage as if it were their own.

If the wizard in the above example had taken the time to explain his research
results to his allies, then the GM might allow the wizard to convert that
advantage to group advantage. Any of the adventurers would be able to use the
wizard's group advantage while exploring the jungle.

## Enemies with Advantage
Advantage is an area where the Multi Roll and Single Roll systems diverge. In
the Multi Roll game mode, non-player characters spend advantage to increase
their rolls. In Single Roll game modes, non-player characters spend their
advantage to decrease rolls that players make against them.
