# Leveling Up
As you adventure in Tavern Tales, you will learn from your experiences and
become stronger. The requirement for advancement is simple: do interesting
things.

Of course, the definition of "interesting things" varies depending on the
gaming group. One gaming group might prefer dungeon crawls and monster battles,
while another gaming group might prefer political intrigue and sandbox-style
gameplay. For that reason, Tavern Tales doesn't rigidly define character
advancement. It's up to the gaming group to work together to determine a
character advancement option that works best for them. Here are some of the
most popular advancement options:

* Combat: Kill a dangerous monster.
* Exploration: Explore a perilous dungeon.
* Interaction: Resolve an important political problem.
* Quest: Complete an adventure.
* Personal: Explore a character's backstory and develop their personality.
* Roleplay: Have engaging in-character conversations with other characters.
* Sandbox: Go out into the world and find adventure.
* All of the above!

Killing monsters isn't the only way to level up. If your gaming group adores
sandbox-style gameplay, then the players might level up by purchasing and
outfitting a naval ship so that they can seek adventure across the high seas.
If your gaming group emphasizes roleplaying, the players might level up by
helping one of the player characters mend a broken relationship with her
family.

It's important for the GM and the players to clearly communicate so that
everybody knows the driving purpose of the game. Is it to kill monsters? The GM
should reward players for running into battle. Is it political intrigue? The GM
should reward players for attending a noble masquerade. Most gaming groups will
use a combination of these factors, possibly even all of them.

## Levels and Leveling Up
Your level is the number of traits and upgrades that you have. Since you start
character creation with 3 traits, that means that you start the game at level
3.

It's important to note that the GM has the option of starting characters at a
much higher or lower number. For example, the GM could start the players at
level 15 for a high-level game. Alternatively, the GM could start the players
at level 0 (none of the players have any traits) so that the players can
roleplay their first steps into the world of adventuring.

It's generally recommended that players start at level 3 because then they will
each have 1 combat, 1 exploration, and 1 interaction trait.

When the GM feels that the players have fulfilled the purpose of the game, the
players get to level up. A player who levels up selects one of the following
options:

* Upgrade a Trait they already have.
* Gain a new Trait.

Remember: when you level up, you must advance traits as evenly as possible
between combat, exploration, and interaction.

## Gaining New Traits
When you select a new trait, you are making your character more flexible and
well-rounded. You can select any trait from any theme. However, as always, you
must advance evenly between combat, exploration, and interaction.

> (Tracking/Combat), Gut Instinct (Savagery/Exploration), and Military
> Connections (Warfare/Interaction).
>
> Since Dabney has an equal number of combat, exploration, and tracking traits,
> he has the option of selecting his next trait from any category when he
> levels up. When he reaches level four, he selects Nomad, a
> Savagery/Interaction trait.
>
> At level five, Dabney must now select either a combat or an exploration
> trait. He picks You Dare!?, a Dragon/Combat trait.

## Upgrading Existing Traits
Upgrades allow players to customize their characters by putting unique spins on
their favorite traits. To do so, a player selects an upgrade from the list
below and applies it to a trait that they already have. These upgrades are
intentionally vague and ambiguous, because a balanced upgrade for one trait may
not be balanced if it's applied to another trait. Players and the GM should
work together to agree upon a balanced, logical interpretation of the rules.

### Frequency
You can use this trait more often than normal. Example changes:

* Once per session &#8594; Twice per session
* Write X on your character sheet &#8594; Write X on your character sheet with
  2 tally marks
* Once every hour or so &#8594; Twice every hour or so

### Potency
The core effect of the trait is more powerful than normal. Example changes:

* For 1d6 turns &#8594; For 2d6 turns
* A creature trusts you &#8594; A creature trusts you deeply
* You find a safe haven &#8594; You find a safe haven that also has valuable
  resources or defensible features

### Precision
The trait is much more precise or subtle than normal, or the trait has less
severe consequences. Example changes:

* It exhausts you for hours &#8594; It exhausts you for minutes
* Include all targets &#8594; Include specific targets
* Loud and obvious &#8954; Subtle and quiet.

### Range
This trait affects more things than normal, or it is more expansive than
normal. Example changes:

* Near &#8594; Close &#8594; Midrange &#8594; Far
* 1 target &#8594; Up to 2 targets &#8594; Up to 3 targets &#8594; etc
* Medium size #&8594; Large size &#8594; Huge size &#8594; etc

### Speed
You can use this trait much more quickly than normal. Example changes:

* Slow Action &#8594; Action &#8594; Simple Action
* Use it on your turn &#8594; Use it on other creatures' turns under specific
  trigger conditions
* Traits are independent &#8594; Using trait X automatically activates trait Y

> and two interaction traits, so he must advance in exploration next. He
> decides to upgrade Gut Instinct (Savagery/Exploration) rather than getting a
> new trait. He begins a conversation with the GM:
>
> Dabney: I really love Gut Instinct and I want to get more use out of it. Can
> I upgrade it?
>
> GM: Sure, what do you have in mind?
>
> Dabney: Well, I like the idea of my character being so attuned to his
> instincts that it borders on being supernatural. I was hoping that I could
> get extra information when I use it.
>
> GM: Sounds like a potency upgrade.
>
> Dabney: That's what I was thinking. Hmm, let's see... How about I add this
> line of text, "Whenever you use Gut Instinct, the GM must tell you something
> important about what your instincts are sensing."
>
> GM: That sounds good to me! Write it on your character sheet. We'll see how
> that upgrade plays out during this next session. Afterward, we'll talk again
> to see if we both think it's balanced. Sound fair?
>
> Dabney: Yep!

When you upgrade traits, keep these important rules in mind:

* Upgrades should enhance what the trait already does, not add something new.
  If you want to do something new, you're probably better off selecting a new
  trait.
* Some traits and upgrades are incompatible. If an upgrade doesn't seem to
  apply to your favorite trait, then just ignore that upgrade and look at other
  possible upgrades. 
* Think cinematically, not mathematically. The GM is encouraged to veto
  upgrades that are overly mathematical (the upgrade enhances numbers without
  making the trait more exciting or interesting, for example). Tavern Tales
  isn't a game that's about exploiting mechanics, it's about doing exciting
  things in dramatic situations. 
* Work with the GM and the other players when you design upgrades. A good
  strategy is to collectively discuss balance as a group in between each
  session. After you play a few sessions, your group may realize that an
  upgrade is over- or under-powered and needs to be tweaked. 
* Every upgrade requires GM approval.

## Restricting Upgrades
By default, Tavern Tales doesn't place any restriction on upgrades. As long as
players evenly distribute their levels between combat, exploration, and
interaction, they can upgrade traits as many times as they want. However,
unlimited restrictions on power can lead to incredibly strong players. The GM
may want to place restrictions on upgrades to prevent players gaining access to
control the game's power level.

Here are a few examples of party-wide restrictions that the GM may want to use:

* Signature Trait: Select 1 of your traits as your signature trait. That is the
  only trait you can upgrade; you can upgrade it as many times as you want.
* Signature Trait x3: Select 1 trait from each category as your signature
  traits. Those are the only traits you can upgrade; you can upgrade them as
  many times as you want.
* Custom Traits: You can upgrade each of your traits only 1 time.
* Custom + Signature: Select 1 of your traits as your signature trait. You can
  upgrade that trait as many times as you want. All other traits you can
  upgrade only once.
* Balanced: A player can't have more upgrades than traits in that category. For
  example, a player with 3 combat traits can have a maximum of 3 combat trait
  upgrades.
* Upgrade Cap (combine with another rule): A player can't upgrade a trait more
  than X times, as determined by the GM.
* Gradual (combine with another rule): Players can't upgrade traits until they
  reach milestones&ndash;perhaps 1 upgrade for every completed story arc.

## Retraining
You can change some aspects of your character by retraining. To retrain, you
simply need to take a week off from the adventuring life and rest. It's a good
idea to retrain in between sessions so that it doesn't disrupt gameplay. You
can retrain the following aspects of your character:

* Traits: You can remove one trait from your character sheet and replace it
  with a new trait. However, there are 2 restrictions:
  - The new trait must be the same theme and category as the old trait. If you
    retrain out of an Arcane combat trait, the new trait must also be Arcane
    combat.
  - You can't retrain out of traits that have been upgraded.
* Upgrades: If one of your traits is upgraded, you can change that upgrade to a
  different upgrade. For example, you might switch from a potency upgrade to a
  speed upgrade.
