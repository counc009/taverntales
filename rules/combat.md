# Combat
## Attacking
You can spend your action to attack. Since you only have 1 action each turn,
that typically means that you will only get 1 attack each turn.

To attack, roll 3d20 and add the appropriate stat bonus or penalty. If the roll
is successful, you hit and deal damage to your target. When you roll damage,
you add whatever stat modifier you used to make the attack. For example, a
creature with brawn +3 makes a brawn attack and rolls 3d20 +3 to see if it
hits. If it does, it deals +3 extra damage. Weapons can also affect attacks
(see the [Weapon Guidelines](../resources/weapon_guidelines) section).

You can attack with any stat.

### Melee Attacks
Melee attacks involve attacks such as punching, biting, or swinging a sword.
You can make a melee attack against any creature that is in your space or an
adjacent space. **The base damage for melee attacks is 1d8.**

### Ranged Attacks
Ranged attacks involve shooting bows, throwing daggers, and hurling rocks. You
can make a ranged attack against any creature within a mid-range distance. It's
possible to make ranged attacks against creatures farther away than that, but
you must decrease the attack roll. The maximum range of all weapons is
determined by the GM (usually whatever is logical). **The base damage for
ranged attacks is 1d6.**

## Life and Damage
All creatures have life, which represents how much damage they can take before
they die. To calculate a creature's maximum life, multiply its toughness by 4.

A creature can never have more life than its maximum. It loses life when it
takes damage, and it gains life when it heals. For example, suppose there is a
creature that has 30 life. If it takes 10 damage, its life total falls to 20.
If it then receives 15 healing, its life total rises to 30.

A creature that is reduced to 0 hit points is defeated. It falls unconscious
and is considered dying. A dying creature rolls 1d20 at the start of each of
its turns until it gets a 1 or a 20. It dies if it rolls a 1, or it stabilizes
if it rolls a 20. A stabilized creature is still unconscious but is no longer
considered dying. When the GM sees fit, a stabilized creature regains
consciousness with 1 life. A dying creature that receives any healing
whatsoever instantly stabilizes and its life total becomes 1. It remains
unconscious until the GM sees fit.

Special events might cause a creature to skip the dying process and immediately
die, such as falling from the top of an enormous mountain or swimming in a pool
of lava. Additionally, creatures can spend an action to kill a dying creature
(slit its throat, bash its skull in, etc).

## Defeat
Some effects in Tavern Tales specifically reference defeated creatures.
Creatures are considered defeated if they lose a fight. It's up to the GM to
decide when a creature is defeated and how long it remains defeated. In
general, a creature is considered defeated if it:

* Loses its remaining life.
* Surrenders.
* Cannot possibly fight back (it's tied up, for example).

## Rolling More or Fewer Damage Die
Some effects cause you to roll more or fewer damage die. Changes to damage die
appear in one of the following two ways:

* Roll +X damage die.
* Roll -X damage die.


The "X" in the above examples can be any number. For example, an effect that
reads "Roll +3 damage die" means that you would roll 3 extra damage die (in
addition to all of the damage die you normally roll) on the attack.

These effects cancel out if you have multiple +X bonuses and -X penalties. For
example, if one effect causes you to roll +3 damage die, and another effect
causes you to roll -1 damage die, then you would roll +2 damage die (in
addition to all of the damage die you normally roll).

> all of his attacks. This means that he rolls 1d8 on melee attacks and 1d6 on
> ranged attacks. He decides that his barbarian doesn't deal nearly enough
> damage, so he selects a trait that reads "You roll +1 damage die." Now, he
> rolls 2d8 on melee attacks and 2d6 on ranged attacks.

> roll any damage die when he attacks. He still gets to add his stat bonus to
> damage. So, if he attacks with a +3 brawn bonus and deals damage, he would
> roll 0d8+3, or 3 damage.

## Block
Block represents armor or physical toughness. When you would take damage,
subtract your block value from the damage. If you would take 10 damage and you
have 2 block, you only take 8 damage. Block can reduce damage to 0. The GM may
decide that block does not apply to special types of damage (standing in fire,
falling from great heights, etc).

## Resting and Healing
Healing restores lost life to your character. You can't heal more than your
maximum life; any excess healing is wasted. In general, your healing is tied to
your toughness&ndash;the higher your toughness, the more you will benefit from
healing effects.

You heal an amount of life equal to your toughness when you get a full night's
rest. The term "full night's rest" appears occasionally in Tavern Tales and
should not be taken literally. You can rest during the day, at dusk, or
whenever you please. You're considered to get a full night's rest as long as
you sleep and/or rest for an extended period of time (8 hours or so) with
accommodations such as food, a bed, and warmth.

## Generic Actions
In addition to attacking and using Traits, all players can perform three
actions: Recuperate, Bolster, and Focus. Despite the fact that these are
generic abilities that everyone has, players are encouraged to reflavor them.
For example, a cleric might describe recuperate as calling down holy light,
whereas an alchemist might flavor it as applying a healing salve to an open
wound.

### Recuperate &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you tend to the wound of yourself or a creature you are touching*
&#8594; The target heals life equal to its toughness. Resisting. Rolling badly
could complicate matters (you don't heal at all, you deal damage by mistake,
you render one of the target's appendages temporarily unusable, etc).

### Focus &bull; Action
*Describe how you thwart incoming attacks* &#8594; Rolls against you are
decreased until the beginning of your next turn.

There are many things that you can do in combat besides attacking. You might
shout encouragement to an ally, tip over a table to provide cover, or raise
your shield to protect an ally. In Tavern Tales, these special attacks are
considered Bolstering. Bolstering costs an action, just like attacking.

### Bolster &bull; Action
*Describe how you bolster yourself or an ally* &#8594; Give the target one
Advantage.

For more information, see the [Advantage section](rolling_dice#advantage).

You can bolster with any stat as long as it is logical to do so, but how you
bolster might affect the range. Note that Bolstering is a mechanical benefit to
a narrative action. If a player tips over a table to provide cover, Bolstering
allows them to gain Advantage while doing so.  

> The paladin wants to bolster, so she shouts battle orders to her nearest
> ally. The GM decides that this is a spirit roll, and that the paladin can
> bolster anyone in earshot.
>
> The fighter wants to bolster, so they raise their shield to protect a nearby
> ally. The GM decides that this is a brawn roll, and the close nature of the
> action means that the fighter can only bolster adjacent creatures.
>
> The rogue wants to bolster, so he flips up onto a nearby table for better
> positioning. The GM decides that this is a finesse roll, and the rogue can
> only bolster himself.

## Grappling
You can roll -1 damage die (possibly bringing you down to 0d8+stat damage) on a
successful melee attack to grapple the target. The two of you can't be
physically separated until the grapple ends.

If the two of you are about the same size, either of you can move at 1 distance
step lower (half speed) and drag the other behind you. If one is significantly
larger than the other, the larger creature can move normally and drag the
smaller creature behind it.

Unwilling participants in a grapple can make one attempt on each of their turns
to break free (as a Quick Action) by winning an opposed roll. The initiator may
end the grapple at any time as a Quick Action.

## Advantage
Having advantage means that you have an edge. Combat advantage is a bit
different from exploration and interaction advantage. Combat advantage still
increases your roll, but it has a few other uses as well.

* Spend advantage when you attack: Increase the attack roll, and roll +1 damage die.
* Spend advantage to defend against an attack: The attacker decreases his
  attack roll, and rolls -1 damage die.
* Increase any 3d20 roll you make that's related to combat.

If you use the second option, the decreased attack and damage roll only applies
to the portion of the attack that affects you. For example, if a dragon
breathes fire on your whole group and you spend advantage to decrease its
attack and damage, then that only applies to the dragon breath that affects
you. The dragon would use its lowest d20 against you and his middle d20 against
your friends.
