# Spaces and Movement
## Spaces and Size
Size is relative. What's big to a mouse is small to a dragon. Size in Tavern
Tales is represented by spaces, which is how much physical space a creature
occupies. Every creature in Tavern Tales occupies 1 space, regardless of how
big it is. That means that the size of 1 space varies from creature to
creature. For a human, 1 space might only be a 5-foot by 5-foot area. For a
dragon, 1 space might be a 50-foot by 50-foot area.

These are the sizes in Tavern Tales and the corresponding space that they
occupy:

* **Tiny:** A tiny creature is the size of a housecat or smaller. It occupies a
  1-foot area or smaller.
* **Small:** A small creature is approximately the size of a human child. It
  occupies a 2-foot area.
* **Medium:** A medium creature is approximately the size of a human. It
  occupies a 5-foot area.
* **Large:** A large creature is about 2-3 times the size of a human. It
  occupies a 10-foot area.
* **Huge:**  A huge creature is approximately the size of a house. It occupies
  a 20-foot area.
* **Gigantic:** A gigantic creature is larger than a two-story mansion. It
  occupies a 50-foot area or larger.

Many traits in Tavern Tales reference spaces. For example, consider the Martial
Arts trait Four Winds Strike:

### Four Winds Strike
*Describe how you attack with force* &#8594; Push the target away from you
until it is no longer close (assuming you can logically do so), and it becomes
resistant to your Four Winds Strike. An additional effect occurs if it collides
with each of the following:

* A creature: That creature is also affected by the attack.
* A solid object: Roll +1 damage die.
* A breakable object: The creature breaks through all breakable objects in its path.
* Nothing: The target is slow for 1 turn.


How far is a close distance? It depends on who's doing the attack! For a human,
a close distance is about 25 feet. For a huge dragon, a close distance is
closer to 250 feet!

## Movement and Speed
Creatures can move up to a set distance. By default, creatures can move a close
distance unless otherwise stated. These are the distance steps from shortest to
longest:

* **Near:** A near distance extends several steps (relative to your size), or 3
  spaces on a battlegrid.
* **Close:** A close distance extends to the size to a room (relative to your
  size), or 5 spaces on a battlegrid.
* **Mid-range:** A mid-range distance extends to the size of a building
  (relative to your size), or 10 spaces on a battlegrid.
* **Far:** A far distance extends to the size of several buildings (relative to
  your size), or 20 spaces on a battlegrid.

Moving is a normally a simple action. If you attempt an extremely complicated
movement (climbing a rock wall while trying to be stealthy, swimming while
keeping an unconscious ally afloat, etc), the GM might shorten the distance
that you can travel or have the movement cost your action for that turn.

If you need to determine the exact distance that a creature moves, multiply the
feet it occupies by the spaces it moves. For example, suppose a human moves 3
spaces. Humans are medium, which means that they occupy 5 feet. 5&times;3 = 15;
the human moves 15 feet. When you move 1 space, you don't have to move the
entire space. For example, suppose that a 50-foot-long dragon wants to move 10
feet forward. It normally moves 50 feet when it moves 1 space. If the dragon
wants to, it can move forward only a fraction of its 50-foot space.

## Battlegrid vs Theater of the Mind
There are two types of play styles that involve movement: battlegrid and
theater of the mind. Tavern Tales was designed to accommodate both of these
options.

### Battlegrid
The battle grid approach involves using game miniatures and a battle map to
create an accurate representation of battles. If you prefer this method of
gameplay, then handling movement and spaces is simply a matter of using the
right minis. For medium creatures, use minis that occupy 1 square/hex on the
battlegrid. For large creatures, use minis that occupy 2&times;2 squares/hexes.
And so on...

### Theater of the Mind
Gamers who use the theater of the mind (TOTM) approach avoid battlegrids,
preferring instead to imagine the action. If your gaming group uses this
approach, it is recommended that you stick with qualitative descriptions.

Don't worry about exact numbers, measurements, and speed, because these values
bog down TOTM gameplay. Instead, focus on the game's qualitative descriptions.
A large creature is exactly that: large. A close distance is exactly that:
close. Who moves farther: a medium creature that moves a midrange distance, or
a huge creature that moves a close distance? You could do the calculation, but
why bother? Just go with what feels right: TOTM gameplay is meant to be loose
and intuitive, so don't let math slow you down.

## Hurrying
When you start your turn, you can announce that you hurry. On that turn, you
decrease all rolls you make and the distance you can move goes up 1 step, which
doubles the distance you can travel. For example, the distance you can move
might increase from close (5 spaces) to mid-range (10 spaces). This doesn't
stack with haste. This applies to all forms of movement: running, climbing,
swimming, flying, etc. Hurrying is particularly exhausting, so the GM might
require you to roll if you hurry for extended periods of time.
