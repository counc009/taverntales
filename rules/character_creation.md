# Character Creation
Tavern Tales is a game that allows you to play as virtually anything. Do you
want to be a feral barbarian who charges into battle? How about a crafty rogue
who uses stealth and deception? Your only limit is your imagination! But before
you draw your magical sword and start slaying monsters, you first have to
create your character. Follow these steps to build your character, recording
each decision on your character sheet:

## Step One: The Concept
The first step is also the most important, because it affects every other
decision during character creation. You must come up with a core concept for
your character. Here are a few things to consider when you come up with your
character concept:

* Where does your character come from?
* What is your character's race and nationality?
* How does your character fight, explore, and socialize?
* What sets your character apart?

Tavern Tales accommodates virtually any character concept imaginable, so feel
free to exercise your creative muscles and come up with something truly unique.
The one guideline you should attempt to follow is that your character should be
physically capable of entering a tavern and having a conversation. That said,
Tavern Tales can easily create characters outside of that range&ndash;if you
want to play one, ask your GM if it's okay.

> game. The GM explains that the game will focus heavily on exploration, so
> Dabney decides that he wants to play as a ranger. A master woodsman would be
> the perfect character for charting the savage wilderness!

## Step Two: Pick Three Traits
Characters in Tavern Tales aren't built from pre-existing classes, races, or
character types. Instead, you represent your character by choosing Traits.
Traits can reflect combat abilities, particular knowledge of the world, the way
your character socializes, your species, and just about anything else you can
imagine. Because you can choose any combination of traits for any character,
Tavern Tales is extremely versatile&ndash;there are well over sixty million
potential level one characters, even before narrative and aesthetic choices.

Traits are divided into Themes, but you don't need to put too much stock in
these. Themes have no mechanical effect&ndash;they only exist to organize the
Traits and make it easier to find what you're looking for.

The Traits in each Theme are divided into three categories: combat,
exploration, and interaction. These do have a mechanical effect: when you level
up, you must add a Trait from the category you have the fewest in. If your
character has one combat trait, two exploration Traits, and one interaction
Trait, they'll need to select a combat or interaction Trait when leveling up.

When creating a character, select one trait from each category. Remember: the
traits that you select don't have to all be from the same theme.

> * Warfare: Great if I want some extra power.

> * Faith: I could go with a "pursuit of justice" concept while bounty hunting.

>
> For combat, he selects Hunter from Tracking. For exploration, he selects Gut
> Instinct from Savagery. For interaction, he selects Military Connections from

> Dabney opted to spread his traits out across three themes, but he could have
> selected fewer themes if he liked. He could have selected all three traits
> from one theme, or he could have selected two traits in one theme and his
> third trait from another theme.

## Step Three: Assign Your Stats
Every character has four stats: brawn, finesse, mind, and spirit.

Assign the following values however you like among these stats: +3, +2, +1, -1.

Whenever you make a 3d20 roll, you assign the corresponding bonus or penalty
from that stat. For example, a character has +3 brawn, +2 finesse, +1 mind, and
-1 spirit. They want to climb a rock wall, which the GM decides is a brawn
roll. The player rolls 3d20 and adds +3 to their primary die to determine the
final result (see [Rolling Dice](rolling_dice) for more information).

### Brawn
Brawn is a measure of physical fitness, might, intimidation factor,
athleticism, and strength. You typically roll brawn whenever you are:

* Brutish and strong.
* Straightforward and direct.
* Physically powerful.
* Intimidating.

### Finesse
Finesse relates to agility, grace, subtlety, precision, and speed. You
typically roll finesse whenever you are:

* Subtle and smooth.
* Agile and graceful.
* Deceptive and sneaky.
* Quick.

### Mind
Mind involves logic, knowledge, memory, perception, and intuition. You
typically roll mind whenever you are:

* Shrewd and intelligent.
* Observant and wise
* Knowledgeable.
* Witty and clever.
* Logical.

### Spirit
Spirit involves willpower, force of personality, morale, and fighting spirit.
You typically roll spirit when you are:

* Willful and determined.
* Charming and inspirational.
* Passionate and emotional.
* Relying on pure luck.
* Tough and enduring.

The stats are meant to be fairly loose and abstract. The players and the GM
will have to use their best judgment to determine which stat applies in a given
situation.

It will often be fairly obvious which stat applies. For example, if a character
is trying to balance on a narrow tightrope, then finesse obviously applies
(they're being agile and graceful). If they runs several miles in order to
catch up with a fleeing villain, spirit obviously applies (he's being tough and
enduring).

Other times, multiple stats can apply. This is especially true in combat,
because characters can attack and bolster with any of the four stats. It's less
about the weapon you use and more about how you attack. For example, suppose
that a player is using a sword in combat. Which stat would they use? Some
players might automatically assume that they have to use brawn, but this isn't
necessarily the case. It depends on how the player describes their action:

* "I clench the hilt of the sword, heft the weapon over my head, and heave the
  blade down into my enemy's skull!" &ndash; Roll brawn.
* "Holding the sword lightly in my hand, I slip into a duelist stance and lunge
  forward with a deadly thrust!" &ndash; Roll finesse.
* "I carefully parry the enemy's attacks, waiting for the right moment to
  strike. As soon as I spot an opening, I deftly exploit the opening in his
  defenses!" &ndash; Roll mind.
* "Wiping the blood from my mouth, I stand defiant against my enemy. 'You'll
  never defeat the forces of good!' I shout defiantly as I wade back into
  battle with renewed vigor." &ndash; Roll spirit.

It may be difficult to represent your character through stats alone. If that's
the case, don't worry&ndash;you can easily round out your character with traits.

For example, barbarians are classically portrayed as unintelligent, but their
feral lifestyles make them excellent trackers and hunters. Intelligence and
tracking capabilities are both tied to the mind stat. So, should a player give
their barbarian low mind to represent the fact that they are unintelligent, or
high mind to represent their incredible tracking ability? An easy way to get
the best of both worlds is to give the barbarian low mind, and then give them a
trait that vastly enhances their tracking abilities (such as To the Ends of the
Earth or Big Game Hunter from the Tracking theme).

> Rangers have a reputation for being gruff loners, so he places the least
> value on spirit. He assigns his bonuses accordingly:
>
> * +1 Brawn
> * +3 Finesse
> * +2 Mind
> * -1 Spirit

## Step Four: Determine Toughness and Starting Life
Your toughness value affects your physical resilience and your ability to
recover from wounds. Your starting life is your toughness value multiplied by
four. Life determines how much damage you can take before you die.

Before your game starts, your gaming group should have a discussion about the
overall feel of the game. Do you want players to feel like larger-than-life
heroes who can shrug off blows, or do you want your game to feel more
realistic, where a single sword blow can be lethal? The GM selects a toughness
value from the list below. By default, the game assumes that players have a
toughness of 10&ndash;this value makes players feel heroic without also making
them feel invincible.

The list below gives a general description of how players will feel about their
character based on their toughness. These aren't the only options&ndash;your
gaming group can decide on any toughness value you like.

* Toughness 1: Weak
* Toughness 5: Vulnerable
* Toughness 10: Dramatic
* Toughness 15: Heroic
* Toughness 20: Unstoppable

Toughness also affects healing. When you heal, you typically heal an amount of
life equal to your toughness. For example, a player with 10 toughness will heal
10 life when they heal.

Optionally, a GM may choose to start your party with low toughness, and allow
you to gain toughness over time. Ask your GM what toughness your character
should start with.

## Step Five: Buy Starting Gear
First, choose a weapon. Weapons in Tavern Tales can be just about anything,
from a sword and buckler or a mace to a holy symbol, a spellbook, or a pair of
six-shooters. Full weapon guidelines are
[here](../resources/weapon_guidelines). Remember that all weapons and armor
can be flavored in any way you see fit.

Alternately, you may choose to fight unarmed. To do so, you must take the Trait
for unarmed ranged or melee combat&ndash;"Power Within" in
[Arcane](../themes/arcane#power-within--passive) and "Thorough Training" in
[Martial Arts](../themes/martial_arts#thorough-training--passive),
respectively.

If you chose a weapon, you may also choose three of the following. If you took
one of the Traits, pick four. You may pick the same thing multiple times.

* Infinite ammunition for your weapon (All ranged weapons either have limited
  ammunition, including fifty arrows/charges/etc. to start, or require this
  option.)
* A bundle of twenty-five arrows/charges/etc. for a ranged weapon, which give
  the weapon an extra keyword when used.
* Two health potions
* An adventurer's kit, containing rope, flint and tinder, torches, a small
  knife, a bedroll, a backpack, a few days rations, and chalk.
* Light Armor (+1 Block)
* Heavy Armor (+2 Block, movement-based rolls at a disadvantage)
* Fifty gold pieces
* A basic medical kit, including bandages, healing salves, etc.
* A set of thieves' tools, including five lockpicks, a file, a few small
  cloths, and a glass cutter.
* A trapmaker's kit, with enough supplies to construct three traps.
* A disguise kit, usable three times.
* Five blast stones (See [Magic Items](../resources/magic_items))


This list should not be considered exhaustive. If you would like to begin the
game with an item of mechanical benefit not listed here, work with your GM to
determine its cost. Your character may also bring along any reasonable number
of non-sellable trinkets, such as mementos, holy symbols or texts, specific
clothing, or other personal items.

> Dabney decides to use a two-handed bow, though he decides not to gain
> infinite ammunition. He chooses light armor, leaving himself with two
> remaining options. He decides to pick up an adventurers kit, and fifty gold
> pieces. He also describes a few other items his character has&ndash;a
> handmade necklace and a letter from an old friend. Neither will mechanically
> impact his character, but both will help flesh them out. 

## Step Six: Aesthetics
You are in complete control of all aesthetic choices with your character. You
can play whatever you want: a human, a dragon, a mechanical golem, or whatever
else you please. You can also change the aesthetics of your traits. If a trait
lets you shoot fireballs, you can rename it to "Ice ball" and shoot explosive
blasts of ice instead.

These aesthetic choices are acceptable as long as they don't affect your
capabilities or statistics. For example, you can't say that you have huge
muscles and therefore deserve a +1 bonus to brawn. Similarly, saying that
you're a dragon doesn't mean that you instantly gain the ability to fly. You
might have wings, but you need a trait that gives you the ability to fly before
you can use them.

> Dabney decides that he wants to put a twist on his bow-wielding ranger, so he
> asks the GM if it's acceptable to play as a humanoid plant creature. The GM
> approves, so Dabney describes his character's bark skin and leafy hair to the
> other players.
>
> Dabney's friend, Parker, is playing as a frost mage. Parker also rewrites
> some aspects of his character to match his frost wizard concept. For example,
> Parker took the trait Barrier from the Arcane theme. The default text for
> Barrier reads, "Describe how you use defensive magic." Parker rewrites it to
> read, "Describe how you create an impenetrable wall of ice." He also renames
> the trait Ice Wall.

## What About Races?
In roleplaying games, players tend to think of their characters as a
combination of race + class, such as a dwarven paladin, a human wizard, or an
elven rogue. Tavern Tales doesn't use this race-class duality because it would
violate one of the core principles of the game: you get to define your
character.

Themes are tools that allow you to build both your race and your class. For
example, elves are typically portrayed as nature lovers who wield bows. You
could take a few traits from the Tracking theme to represent your elven
heritage. But what if you are playing in a setting where elves hate nature and
instead pursue the magical arts? In that case, you might want to take traits
from the Arcane theme. It's up to you and your gaming group to decide if elves
fit the traditional stereotype, or if they're something completely different.

Suppose a character has 10 traits in the Faith theme. Does that mean that Faith
represents their class, race, or both? That's entirely up to the player. If
they're playing as a winged angel with a burning halo of fire, then Faith
probably represents their race. If they're playing as a human who is intensely
devoted to their god, then Faith probably represents their class. If they're
playing as a righteous paladin who is also a descendant of a demigod, then
Faith probably represents both their race and their class.
