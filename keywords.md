# Keywords
* **[Accurate](resources/weapon_guidelines.md):** The base damage of your ranged
  attacks is d8 instead of d6 (does not affect melee attacks).
* **Authority:** You are an expert on a certain topic. Whenever you encounter
  something that relates to that topic, you can declare a fact about it. If the
  GM agrees that your fact is reasonable, it becomes true. If the GM doesn't
  think your fact is reasonable, they must work with you so that you can
  declare a different fact.
* **[Binding](resources/weapon_guidelines.md):** Increase your rolls to
  maintain grapples.
* **Blast:** A blast affects the targeted space and all adjacent spaces.
* **Bleed:** A bleeding creature takes one-tenth damage on each of its turns,
  ignoring block (refer to the Keywords section for more information on
  one-tenth life). This effect ends when the subject receives any healing, or
  after someone spends an action tending to the wound. A creature can suffer
  from any number of bleed effects at once, but it can't have multiple
  instances of the same bleed effect. Bleed effects can have any aesthetic you
  like (the creature is poisoned, on fire, bleeding from an open wound, etc).
* **Blind:** You can't see. While blind, decrease your attack rolls and all
  other rolls that are rely on sight.
* **Buff:** A buff is any temporary boost to your combat capabilities.
  Advantage doesn't count as a buff.
* **[Cleansing](resources/weapon_guidelines.md):** When you spend advantage and
  bolster, remove 1 debuff from yourself or a visible ally.
* **[Close](rules/spaces_and_movement):** A close distance extends to the size
  to a room (relative to your size), or 5 spaces on a battlegrid.
* **Cone:** A cone affects everything in a 90 degree arc in front of you out to
  a near distance (3 spaces on a battlegrid).
* **[Creative License](rules/additional_rules.md):** You temporarily take
  control of the story while you exercise your creative license.
* **Debuff:** A debuff is any temporary penalty to your combat capabilities.
  Damage doesn't count as a debuff.
* **[Defensive](resources/weapon_guidelines.md):** You have +2 block.
* **Defy:** If you would be affected by something that you defy, you instead
  gain 1 advantage. For example, suppose that you defy terror. If something
  would terrify you, you aren't terrified and you instead gain 1 advantage. If
  you have double immunity to something, you defy it. For example, if a trait
  makes you immune to slow and an item also makes you immune to slow, you now
  defy slow.
* **Disarm:** You send an item that the target is holding clattering a close
  distance away. You or an ally along the item's path can catch the item.
* **[Disarming](resources/weapon_guidelines.md):** When you spend advantage and
  deal damage, disarm the target.
* **Disease:** A disease is an illness. Diseases cannot be removed by things
  that remove debuffs unless the effect specifically states that it removes
  diseases.
* **Ethereal:** Your body and equipment is insubstantial. You can't touch,
  attack, or bolster non-ethereal objects or creatures, and they can't touch,
  attack, or bolster you. You can phase through most materials like a ghost,
  but you may be unable to pass through some magical barriers or spiritual
  wards.
* **[Far](resources/spaces_and_movement.md):** A far distance extends to the
  size of several buildings (relative to your size), or 20 spaces on a
  battlegrid.
* **Fly**: You can fly, maneuvering about as well as a bird in flight. You have
  to continue moving in order to stay aloft. Your movement distance is the same
  while flying, so things that increase or decrease your movement similarly
  affect your flying speed. You fall if you lose control or consciousness.
* **[Gigantic](resources/spaces_and_movement.md):** A gigantic creature is
  larger than a two-story mansion. It occupies a 50-foot area or larger.
* **Glide:** You can glide through the air. You gradually lose altitude while
  gliding (generally 1 space per turn). You can't gain altitude from gliding
  unless there is a strong updraft. You have to continue moving in order to
  stay aloft. Your movement distance is the same while gliding, so things that
  increase or decrease your movement similarly affect your gliding speed. You
  fall if you lose control or consciousness.
* **[Grapple](rules/combat.md):** You can roll -1 damage die (possibly bringing
  you down to 0d8+stat damage) on a successful melee attack to grapple the
  target. The two of you can't be physically separated until the grapple ends.
  If the two of you are about the same size, either of you can move at 1
  distance step lower (half speed) and drag the other behind you. If one is
  significantly larger than the other, the larger creature can move normally
  and drag the smaller creature behind it. Unwilling participants in a grapple
  can make one attempt on each of their turns to break free (which doesn't cost
  an action) by winning an opposed roll.
* **Halt:** A halted creature is immobile and can't move to other spaces. This
  doesn't affect the creature's ability to move its body parts (it can still
  swing a sword, for example.
* **[Huge](rules/spaces_and_movement.md):** A huge creature is approximately
  the size of a house. It occupies a 20-foot area.
* **[Hurry](rules/spaces_and_movement.md):** When you start your turn, you can
  announce that you hurry. On that turn, you decrease all rolls you make and
  the distance you can move goes up 1 step, which doubles the distance you can
  travel. For example, the distance you can move might increase from Close (5
  spaces) to Mid-range (10 spaces).
* **Lair:** A lair is an area that serves as your dwelling. You can claim an
  uninhabited area as your lair after living in it for about a day, which
  causes you to give up your claim to the old lair. A lair can be as small as a
  single room or as large as a fortress or cavern complex.
* **[Large](rules/spaces_and_movement.md):** A large creature is about 2-3
  times the size of a human. It occupies a 10-foot area.
* **Line:** A line includes every square in a straight line out to a close
  distance. Lines are 5 spaces long and 1 space wide.
* **Maim:** You inflict a debilitating wound (break bones, sever an arm, gouge
  out an eye, etc) that is permanent or semi-permanent. An effect can't heal a
  maimed wound unless it specifically states that it can. The GM decides the
  mechanical consequences, or they may allow the attacker to choose the
  consequences. Options are limitless, but the most common consequences are:
  - Slowed
  - Reduce a stat by 2
  - Can't use an appendage
  - Amputated body part
  - Decrease a certain type of roll.
* **[Medium](rules/spaces_and_movement.md):** A medium creature is
  approximately the size of a human. It occupies a 5-foot area.
* **[Melee](resources/weapon_guidelines.md):** When you make a melee attack
  with a weapon that doesn't have the melee keyword, roll -1 damage die
  (possibly bringing you down to 0d8+stat damage).
* **[Midrange](rules/spaces_and_movement.md):** A midrange distance extends to
  the size of a building (relative to your size), or 10 spaces on a battlegrid.
* **Minion:** A minion is a non-player character who willingly obeys you. You
  can gain a minion through virtually any means (you hire a mercenary, you
  convince somebody to help you for several weeks, a soldier is required to
  obey your commands, etc). Anyone can gain minions; you don't need to have a
  special trait to gain minions.
* **Mount:** A mount is a creature that can carry a rider. As long as a rider
  and his mount are within the vicinity of each other, they share the same turn
  and pool of actions. Usually, a rider will give up his opportunity to move so
  that his mount can move. A rider can also give up his action to use one of
  his mount's actions. Anything that affects the rider also affects the
  mount&ndash;when one takes a buff, debuff, or damage, the other does as well.
* **[Near](rules/spaces_and_movement.md):** A near distance extends several
  steps (relative to your size), or 3 spaces on a battlegrid.
* **One-tenth:** This is one-tenth of a creature's maximum life. To determine
  that value, remove the right-most number from the creature's maximum life.
  For example, one-tenth of 149 maximum life is 14, and one-tenth of 55 maximum
  life is 5.
* **[Piercing](resources/weapon_guidelines.md):** When you spend advantage to
  attack, the attack ignores block.
* **[Ranged](resources/weapon_guidelines.md):** When you make a ranged attack
  with a weapon that doesn't have the ranged keyword, roll -1 damage die
  (possibly bringing you down to 0d6+stat damage).
* **[Reach](resources/weapon_guidelines.md):** Your melee attacks can reach
  near targets. Your ranged attacks can reach targets out to a far distance.
* **Regeneration:** A regenerating creature gradually heals life at a rate of about
  1 life every half hour (round up to an even 50 life per day). They also
  gradually regrow lost limbs and repair wounds caused by the maim effect.
* **[Rending](resources/weapon_guidelines.md):** When you spend advantage and
  deal damage, inflict bleed on the target.
* **Resisting:** When a creature is affected by something with the resisting
  keyword, it resists that effect for the next day or so. It essentially
  becomes immune to the effect for a brief time. Creatures lose their
  resistances after they get a full night's sleep. Resistance applies to
  specific effects from specific creatures. For example, suppose the dragon
  Blackscale unleashes a terrifying roar to scare an adventurer. The adventurer
  runs away in fear and becomes resistant to Blackscale's roar. The adventurer
  can't be affected by Blackscale's roar for the next day or so, but he can
  still be affected by other terror-causing effects&ndash;even the roars of
  other dragons. Resistance doesn't affect pre-existing conditions.
* **Safe Fall:** By default, you can fall 5 spaces and not take damage when you
  land. For every space you fall after that, you take 5 damage (ignoring block)
  when you land. If you have Safe Fall, add that number to the number of spaces
  you can fall before you take damage when you land. Multiple sources of Safe
  Fall stack with the default 5. For example, if you have Safe Fall 10 from one
  trait and Safe Fall 5 from another trait, you can fall 20 spaces and not take
  damage when you land. If you fall 21 spaces, you would take 5 damage when you
  land.
* **Shatter:** When a creature is shattered, its block becomes 0. If a creature
  is shattered as part of an attack, this happens before dealing damage.
  Restoring shattered block is typically a slow action, and entails whatever is
  logical (repairing armor, recasting defensive wards, healing wounds so that
  protective scales reform, etc).
* **[Staggering](resources/weapon_guidelines.md):** When you spend advantage
  and deal damage, knock the target back a near distance (assuming you can
  logically do so).
* **Stuck:** Something is limiting your moment. Any of your present foes can
  spend your stuck to end your movement (before or during your movement).
* **Shrine:** A shrine is structure that serves as a divine conduit. Each
  shrine is devoted to a specific god. Shrines generally range in size from a
  piece of furniture to a huge building, but they can be much larger or
  smaller. Shrines can be destroyed like any other feature of the environment,
  but doing so typically invokes the wrath of the god it represents and its
  followers. Anyone can touch a shrine to gain its bonus as long as they are
  not despised by that god. You don't need traits from the Faith theme to use a
  shrine.
* **Slow:** The distance you can move goes down 1 step, which halves the
  distance you can travel. For example, the distance you can move might fall
  from Close (5 spaces) to Near (3 spaces). If you already move a Near distance
  and you are slowed, you can't move at all.
* **[Small](rules/spaces_and_movement.md):** A small creature is approximately
  the size of a human child. It occupies a 3-foot area.
* **Soak:** Soak counts as life with a few exceptions: soak can't be healed, it
  wears off after about 1 minute, and you always lose soak before losing life.
  Soak can exceed your maximum life, but you can only have one source of soak
  at a time; if you gain soak from multiple sources, keep whichever one gives
  you the most soak.
* **Stun:** Stunned creatures can't act. They remain standing and can still
  hold onto items while stunned, but they stop doing anything that's more
  complicated than that (climbing, casting a spell, holding aloft something
  heavy, etc).
* **Surprised:** If you attack a creature that has no way of knowing that you
  are going to attack it (you strike from the shadows, you attack a sleeping
  creature, you attack a creature that completely trusts you, etc), that
  creature is considered surprised by you for 1 turn. Increase your attack
  rolls against creatures that you surprise.
* **Temporary Trait:** A temporary trait is a trait that you have under special
  circumstances, or for a short period of time. Temporary traits do not affect
  your level. You do not have to distribute temporary traits evenly between
  combat, exploration, and interaction; you can distribute them as unevenly as
  you want.
* **Terror:** When a creature becomes terrified, it immediately moves in a safe
  path in order to get as far away as possible from the thing that it fears.
  While terrified, it can't willingly move closer to the thing that it fears or
  attack it.
* **[Tiny](rules/spaces_and_movement.md):** A tiny creature is the size of a
  house cat or smaller. It occupies a 1-foot area or less.
* **Wall:** A wall is some sort of barrier. A wall can be any number of spaces
  long. By default, walls are 1 space high. Walls exist in the border between
  spaces. They don't have to form a straight line and they can't form a loop.
