# Bestiary
Monster creation in Tavern Tales follows this basic formula: **Size +
Difficulty + Identity**

## Size
Size determines how big the monster is. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide
how large you want your monster to be. The general rule of thumb is that big
monsters should be strong and small monsters should be weak, but you can break
this rule whenever you think it's appropriate.

## Difficulty
The difficulty is a measure of the monster's power. Difficulty is perhaps the
most important factor in monster creation because it determines how lethal an
encounter will be. Fodder will hardly pose any threat at all to adventurers,
whereas bosses are brutal killing machines that could potentially slaughter an
entire adventuring group.

### Fodder
You are at the mercy of adventurers.

* **Stats:** Total net bonus of +0, Maximum stat bonus of +1 (Ex: +1, +1, 0,
  -2)
* **Combat:** 0-1 damage die, 1 life, 0 block, bolster for 1 advantage

### Minion
You are easy prey.

* **Stats:** Total net bonus of +2, Maximum stat bonus of +2 (Ex: +2, +1, 0,
  -1)
* **Combat:** 1 damage die, 20 life, 1 block, bolster for 1 advantage

### Adversary
You are about as strong as an adventurer.

* **Stats:** Total net bonus of +5, Maximum stat bonus of +3 (Ex: +3, +2, +1,
  -1)
* **Combat:** 1 damage die, 40 life, 2 block, bolster for 1 advantage

### Nemesis
You are much stronger than average.

* **Stats:** Total net bonus of +7, Maximum stat bonus of +4 (Ex: +4, +3, +1,
  -1)
* **Combat:** 2 damage die, 80 life, 4 block, bolster for 2 advantage

### Boss
You can probably slaughter an entire adventuring group.

* **Stats:** Total net bonus of +9, Maximum stat bonus of +5 (Ex: +5, +3, +2,
  -1)
* **Combat:** 3 damage die, 150 life, 6 block, bolster for 3 advantage

## Identity
The monster's identity determines what the monster is and what it does. Is it a
fire-breathing dragon? A web-spinning spider? The lore explains the monster's
history, appearance, behavior, and traits. Find a list of monster identities
below.

Each monster has a list of suggested traits. The name of the trait is listed at
the end of the description, followed by an abbreviation of the trait's theme. A
"+" in front of the trait name indicates that it has been upgraded. For
example, "(++Flight, EL)" means that the trait is Flight from the Elements
theme, and it has been upgraded twice. A trait with a "-" in front of it means
that the trait is weaker than normal, typically for thematic reasons.
"(Custom)" indicates that the monster has a unique trait that doesn't exist in
any of the themes.
