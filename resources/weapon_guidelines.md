# Weapon Guiddlines
## Weapons
In Tavern Tales, you are in complete control of your character's aesthetics.
That rule also extends to your character's weapons. It's entirely up to you to
define what weapons your character uses, and how he uses those weapons in
combat. Because of this, Tavern Tales allows you to choose your weapons'
mechanics and their aesthetics separately.

A weapon's aesthetics is what it looks like (your weapon is a simple longsword,
a serrated axe, a glowing mace, etc). Weapon aesthetics are limitless and
completely within your control.

Weapon mechanics work a bit differently. To understand weapon mechanics in
Tavern Tales, consider the following question: What does a staff do in a
fantasy world?

* To a barbarian, a staff is a blunt weapon suitable for bashing skulls.
* To a monk, a staff is a precise weapon that requires speed and finesse.
* To a wizard, a staff shoots fireballs and bolts of lightning.

Clearly, weapons mean different things to different people. For that reason,
it's up to you to decide the mechanics of your weapons. When you pick up or use
a weapon for the first time, you must decide on the weapon keywords for those
weapons. You get 2 weapon keywords from the list below. This applies regardless
of how many items you are holding. A person wielding a sword and shield, a
person wielding a pair of daggers, a person wielding a single rapier, and a
person wielding a two-handed great axe each get 2 weapon keywords.

This flexibility allows players to create truly unique fighting styles. For
example, a player might decide that holding a shield and no weapon grantsranged
and piercing. In this case, it's a good idea for the player to describe why
holding a shield grants that fighting style. Perhaps he emits beams of holy
light from his shield, or perhaps he throws his shield before having it bounce
back to his hand.

It's a good idea to record your decision on the character sheet. For example,
suppose you decide that holding a sword grants you melee anddisarming. You
sheathe your sword, and a few days later you draw it again. At that point, the
sword should still grant you melee and disarming. Recording weapon keywords on
your character sheets ensures that you are consistent from combat to combat.

The most common traits are melee and ranged, but players are not obligated to
select those options. A player might instead opt for leadership-based keywords
(defensive and cleansing, perhaps). Also, if a trait grants a player the melee
keyword with all of his weapons, then the player might opt for a more offensive
combination (disarming and reach, perhaps).

## Weapon KeywordS
### Melee
When you make a melee attack with a weapon that doesn't have the melee keyword,
roll -1 damage die (possibly bringing you down to 0d8+stat damage).

### Ranged
When you make a ranged attack with a weapon that doesn't have the ranged
keyword, roll -1 damage die (possibly bringing you down to 0d6+stat damage).

### Accurate
The base damage of your ranged attacks is d8 instead of d6 (does not affect
melee attacks).

### Binding
Increase your rolls to maintain grapples.

### Cleansing
When you spend advantage and bolster, remove 1 debuff from yourself or a
visible ally.

### Defensive
You have +2 block.

### Disarming
When you spend advantage and deal damage, disarm the target.

### Explosive
When you spend advantage and deal damage to a creature, you may choose to deal
damage to all adjacent creatures at -1 damage die.

### Reach
Your melee attacks can reach near targets. Your ranged attacks can reach
targets out to a far distance.

### Rending
When you spend advantage and deal damage, inflict bleed on the target.

### Piercing
When you spend advantage to attack, the attack ignores block.

### Staggering
When you spend advantage and deal damage, knock the target back a near distance
(assuming you can logically do so).

Here are a few examples of keyword combinations:

* Sword and shield: Melee and defensive
* Pair of axes: Melee and rending
* Magic wand: Ranged and accurate
* Sword and Pistol: Melee and ranged

## Retraining
You can retrain your weapon keywords in much the same way that you retrain
theme traits. If you practice weapon drills for a few hours, you can change the
weapon keywords that the weapons grant you. This change takes place when your
character levels up, or at GM discretion.

## Unarmed Attacks
By default, your body doesn't count as a weapon and therefore can't gain weapon
keywords. Consequently, you must roll -1 damage die when you make an unarmed
attack because you don't have the melee or ranged weapon keywords. However,
players can get around this restriction. Some traits, items, and effects read:

* Your body counts as a weapon, and your weapons have the melee keyword for
  free. ([Thorough Training, Martial
  Arts](../themes/martial_arts.md#thorough-training--passive))
* Your body counts as a weapon, and your weapons have the ranged keyword for
  free. ([Power Within, Arcane](../themes/arcane.md#power-within--passive))

If you have one of these effects, then you are able to add the default 2 weapon
keywords to your body (which now counts as a weapon). For example, suppose a
martial artist has "Your body counts as a weapon and gains the melee keyword
for free." He might choose to gain the bindingand defensive keywords in
addition to his free melee keyword to represent his wrestling fighting style.

To sum up, the weapon rules are as follows:

* If you make a melee attack without the melee keyword, or a ranged attack
  without the ranged keyword, you decrease the roll.
* You can apply 2 keywords to your weapons. It doesn't matter how many weapons
  you hold&ndash;you always get 2 keywords.
* You can't apply weapon keywords to your fists (or other natural attacks)
  because your body isn't a weapon. Some traits count your body as a weapon,
  which allows you to overcome this restriction.
* Many effects give you weapon keywords for free. You gain these keywords in
  addition to the 2 default keywords.

## What Counts as a Weapon?
Often, it is easy to decide what constitutes a weapon. Swords and bows are
obviously weapons, but what about an enchanted holy symbol? Or what about a bar
stool? Or a shield? Ultimately, it's up to your gaming group to decide what
counts as a weapon. The GM should be flexible when it comes to magical items
such as wands, holy symbols, totems, and spellbooks. It's usually a good idea
to define which of these items count as weapons in your campaign. For example,
you might want to clarify that a book has to have magical spells written in it
before it can count as a weapon. Otherwise, a wizard who gets disarmed might
pick up the nearest book&ndash;a pamphlet or a diary, perhaps&ndash;and try to
use it as a weapon.

There needs to be a distinction between weapons and non-weapons. If everything
counts as a weapon, then players never have to worry about being disarmed or
going into battle unarmed.

Keep in mind that if you count an item as a weapon, that doesn't necessarily
mean that it has to be compatible with every weapon keyword. For example, the
GM might conclude that a dagger can't have reach because daggers are so short.
