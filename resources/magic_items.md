# Magic Items
Like everything else in Tavern Tales, magic items are intended to be flexible
and exciting. Each magic item comes with a description and 3 bulleted options. 

* **The first bullet** indicates a relatively weak, low-powered effect. These
  magic items are ideal for fledgling adventurers.
* **The second bullet** indicates a powerful, iconic effect. These magic items
  are suitable for experienced adventurers. 
* **The third bullet** indicates a legendary, game-changing effect. These items
  are appropriate for epic adventurers. 

Each effect comes with a short lore entry. You are welcome to ignore, change, or use these lore entries as you see fit. Perhaps you can use them as inspiration for developing your own history for the item. 

## Item Themes
Magic items are organized by theme. This organization system has no mechanical
bearing on the game whatsoever. Anybody can use any item, regardless of theme.
The items are organized by theme to make it easier for players and GMs to find
appropriate items. For example, if the players explore a wizard's tower and
find magic items, the GM can very easily look at the Arcane section for a list
of logically appropriate magic items.

## Alchemy
### Bunsen's Burner
This strange contraption resembles a leather backpack with tubes and canisters
protruding from it. A hose-like attachment complete with buttons and levers
juts from backpack's lower corner. 

**According to legend...**

* A rich and deranged Prince Bunsen demanded a fire-breathing mechanical dragon
  for his coronation ceremony. The king's servant hired a skilled alchemist to
  build this contraption, which was installed in the dragon's mouth. It spews
  fire as per Dragon's Breath (DR). Recharge by pouring flammable materials
  into the backpack. 
* A benevolent alchemist developed a potion atomizer so that battle medics
  could quickly distribute a fog of healing potion mist across wounded troops.
  A young soldier named Bunsen had the idea to replace healing potions with
  alchemical fire, transforming the medical tool into a weapon of terrifying
  destruction. The backpack has 4 canisters, which can be loaded with potions
  as a slow action. The potions can be dispersed in a cone through the
  hose-like attachment. Atomized potions are just as potent as normal.
* After defeating the flame titan Grazgor, a powerful alchemist named Bunsen
  built a containment cell to hold the monster's ever-burning heart. The heart
  was much more powerful than Bunsen expected, so he was forced to build a
  release nozzle to relieve pressure. Serendipitously, this add-on gave Bunsen
  his newest weapon. The backpack generates 1 gout of lava every day. If it
  ever contains 10 gouts of lava, the backpack explodes with the force of a
  volcanic eruption. The nozzle releases a gout of lava in a line that also
  maims anyone it touches. 

### Emperor Yang's Teapot
This porcelain teapot is inscribed with ancient symbols. A blue snake-like
dragon coils around the pot, its body forming the handle and its mouth forming
the spout. 

**According to legend...**

* In the kingdom of Houchin, the emperor is bound by the ancient and revered
  tea ceremony. This teapot has served the Yang family for millennium. So long
  as the tea still steams, drinkers of the tea are able to communicate with
  each other in the language of the teapot's homeland. Also, drinkers find
  their nerves calmed. 
* Emperor Yang's 18 sons all vied for control of their father's empire. Yang
  commissioned an alchemist to create this pot and set the challenge, "Only
  those worthy of rule can drink from this." All 18 of his sons drank the tea
  and fell dead. Laughing, Yang declared that only he was worthy of ruling his
  empire and took the last sip. He, too, fell dead. Whoever brews a pot of tea
  with this teapot can name a test of worthiness (Only those worthy of rule,
  only a native-born southlander, only one pure of heart, etc). Unworthy
  creatures who drink the tea die within seconds, but only if they are aware of
  the test. 
* According to legend, a traveller approached a humble tea farmer and asked for
  a cup of tea. The farmer obliged and used his finest tea leaves. When the
  teapot was empty, the delighted traveller revealed herself to be Qing Ma,
  Goddess of Civilizations, and crowned the tea farmer as first emporer of what
  would become the Yang Dynasty. All of the people within a kingdom (the GM
  chooses which) culturally believe that the last person to drink from this
  teapot has the divine right to rule as emperor. 

### Glass Mosquito
This tiny figurine perfectly resembles glass mosquito. Its bulbous abdomen is
large enough to hold a few drops of liquid. 

**According to legend...**

* Alchemists discovered that glass infused with starlight can create unique
  sound frequencies. When struck, this glass mosquito emits a hypersonic
  ringing chime that attracts a swarm of mosquitoes. The mosquitoes don't deal
  damage -- they are just extremely annoying.
* A group of poor rebels banded together to create a weapon that could
  assassinate the well-guarded members of the ruling class. After trying
  everything from enchanted bows to cloaks of invisibility, they finally came
  up with the humble glass mosquito. Its body can hold a single potion dose.
  The user can give the mosquito instructions, and the diminutive construct
  will dutifully fly off to bite its target and inject the potion. Then, the
  mosquito will fly back to its owner.
* The scorching sands of the Blazak Desert can spontaneously liquefy into
  sheets of boiling glass. When the glass cools at night, nomads shatter the
  glass lakes with massive stone hammers to harvest the creatures stuck in the
  glass. The possessor can command the mosquito to animate and bite a target.
  Its bite causes the target to slowly turn to glass over the course of about 1
  day. The target can still move while it is glass, but it is extremely
  fragile. 

### Gourd of Morning Dew
This hourglass-shaped gourd has a rich brown color and a leathery exterior. A
silk rope winds around its midsection, offering a convenient attachment point
to a belt or backpack. A thick cork is wedged into the gourd's top. 

**According to legend...**

* For centuries, shamans would use this gourd to collect morning dew, which
  they used in their vision quests. The gourd absorbed the shamanic energy over
  the years and continues to perform its morning ritual. Morning dew placed in
  this gourd becomes an extremely powerful hallucinogenic. 
* A bard was obsessed with finding the world's most perfect wine, and
  eventually found it in a bottle of 412 Greyvine. After drinking it all, he
  gave the last drop to an alchemist and asked for a way to preserve the wine
  indefinitely. It was the worst mistake he ever made -- with a constantly
  replenishing bottle of the world's most delicious wine, the bard drank
  himself to an early grave. When under the light of a sunrise, the gourd
  magically replenishes whatever liquid was in it last. 
* A particularly pious alchemist sought to distill sunlight itself. She never
  succeeded, but she did manage to develop a potion container that draws from
  the sun's replenishing energy. If a corpse drinks fresh morning dew from this
  gourd within 24 hours of its death, that creature returns to life. 

### Hizen's Gas Mask
Made of black leather, this sturdy gas mask has metal filters jutting out from
both sides near the mouth. The outer rims of the glass eyepieces are smudged
with alchemical grime.

**According to legend...**

* The ancient alchemist Hizen developed this mask nearly a thousand years ago.
  Since then, it has become a standard tool in virtually every alchemical
  workshop the world over. The wearer is safe from toxic fumes.
* The infamous alchemist Hizen sought to develop the perfect poison, reaching a
  staggering 99.1% lethality rate. Fortified after decades of withstanding the
  most potent chemicals ever devised, this gas mask is the ultimate defense
  against alchemy. The wearer is completely and utterly immune to all adverse
  effects associated with alchemy, poison, and toxic fumes.
* Made from the stomach lining of a Venox Dragon, this gas mask still carries
  the essence of one of the world's most virulent toxins. The left filter
  purifies air, making the wearer immune to toxic fumes. The right filter
  converts the wearer's exhaled air into toxic fumes, which spreads out to a
  far distance in a green mist. Anyone who breathes these fumes bleeds.

### Madilyn's Encrusted Kettle
This kettle instills a random potion or poison upon anything cooked or brewed
within it. The resulting concoction defies all attempts at identification or
analysis. The only way to determine the additional alchemical effect is to use
it on a living subject.

**According to legend...**

* Madilyn was perhaps the filthiest alchemist who ever lived, and never cleaned
  her potion kettle. She died from alchemy-induced illness at the age of 28,
  leaving behind her disgusting kettle for anyone brave enough to follow in her
  grimy footsteps. 
* Madilyn, a prospector, discovered a bizarre metal that caused crystals to
  spontaneously grow across its surface. After she discovered that the crystals
  exhibited alchemical properties, she forged the ore into a potent kettle. 
* Left in the flooded tomb of Queen Madelyn XIV for millennia, this
  once-beautiful kettle is encrusted with a layer of chemical residue. 

### Orgada's Tooth
Any creature struck by this dagger loses 1 life every hour and cannot heal.
Absolutely nothing can remove this poison except for the antidote. Also, 1 dose
of the dagger's poison can be extracted every day or so, but the poison loses
its potency after a few hours.

**According to legend...**

* Orgada, the Queen of Serpents, was a deadly basilisk whose very touch was
  death. Adventurers slew the beast and transformed her tool into a potent
  weapon.
* Before embarking on a vision quest, would-be chieftains of the Emerald Snake
  Clan would prick their fingers on their holy clan artifact. Those who
  completed their quest in time would receive the antidote and gain the right
  to rule the clan. The antidote recipe is a closely-guarded clan secret, or
  perhaps lost to the ages.
* A skilled rogue used this dagger to pierce the poison heart of a corrupted
  dryad. The dagger absorbed a fraction of the dying fey's poisonous blood. 

### Philosopher's Stone
The possessor can touch the stone to a creature or object and change it into
any other creature or object, permanently. Then, the GM changes a law of
reality (wood is now magnetic, iron is now poisonous, sunlight turns fresh
water into salt water, etc).

**According to legend...**

* The philosopher's stone is the physical embodiment of universal laws.
  Destroying it will plunge the universe into rampant chaos.
* This stone is actually the calcified heart of a legendary alchemist.
* An alchemist named Aya swore that she would discover a way to turn lead into
  gold. A few years later, this stone was found in the hands of a beautiful
  golden statue that looked suspiciously like Aya. 

## Arcane
### Akik's Eye
The possessor can name a place and time and then gaze into the orb to see a
cloudy, mysterious vision of it. 

**According to legend...**

* An adventurer visited the giant Akik, who was said to be able to see the
  future. When Akik gazed into what would come and saw her gruesome death, the
  terrified giant refused to tell the adventurer's fortune. The outraged
  adventurer then slaughtered the giant and plucked out her eye.
* The wizard Akik was the world's greatest diviner, capable of spying on
  anything and anyone the world over. His favored crystal ball absorbed a
  fraction of his power over the years.
* This orb contains an imprisoned shaft of sunlight. When released, it flies
  off to the desired destination and then returns to provide a vision of a
  far-off place. 

### Hourglass of Yesterday
The owner can flip the hourglass to go back in time one day. The hourglass
doesn't travel with the owner. It stays where (and when) it was, or goes into
the future, or perhaps back to the creation of the universe. Who can be
certain?

**According to legend...**

* The universe began when the massive Hourglass of Eternity was turned over.
  Someone removed a single grain of sand from the hourglass to build the
  Hourglass of Yesterday, thus bringing the universe one day closer to death.
* After his family was tragically slain by a tidal wave, the deranged wizard
  Xon devoted his life to draining enough energy to turn back the clocks. He
  succeed and crafted this magic item, but was crushed to discover that his
  life's work only amounted to 24 hours of time travel.
* Technically, the hourglass doesn't exist yet. Someone will create it
  tomorrow. 

### Fabric of Reality
The cloak can act as a one-way portal between two locations. For about 1
minute, creatures that walk through the cloak reappear at any place and time
that the GM pleases. Recharge by leaving it under the blinking stars of the
night sky for 3 consecutive nights.

**According to legend...**

* A wizard botched a particularly powerful teleportation spell and ripped out a
  patch of reality. The universe quickly mended itself, leaving this
  cloak-shaped patch of itself behind.
* If destroyed, the cloak will rip open a permanent black hole that sucks
  nearby things into the void. 
* This patch of fabric was left over after the universe was woven together.

### Sunbreaker Kaleidoscope
Looking through this kaleidoscope at a creature or object (an action) causes it
to refract into 1d6 mirror images of itself for several minutes. Any action
taken against that person has an equal chance of hitting any of the images
instead; damaged images vanish. Recharge by looking at the sun through the
kaleidoscope, which is spectacular and not harmful to the eyes. 

**According to legend...**

* A dwarven smith created a hammer so powerful that it could shatter sunlight
  itself. This kaleidoscope contains one such shaft of sunlight, shattered like
  a pane of glass.
* Anyone who looks at a solar eclipse through the kaleidoscope will be able to
  peer into another dimension.
* A star fell from the sky. A mage retrieved the glittering star and set it
  into his handheld telescope to create this magic kaleidoscope.

### Hindago's Reading Spectacles
The wearer can read an entire book simply by touching it.  

**According to legend...**

* An old archmage created these spectacles after falling blind from old age.
* Hindago was a savage barbarian who had a natural knack for magic. A wizard
  saw the young man's talent and was determined to teach him the arcane arts,
  but Hindago had no interest in learning how to read. So, the wizard enchanted
  these glasses and gave them to Hindago. 
* A mage needed a specific arcane rune to finish one of his spells. The
  problem? The rune was written in one of the 306,424 books strewn about his
  tower. After searching for the right book for months, he created these
  glasses and found the rune in a few minutes.

### Key to Nowhere
Any door unlocked by this key becomes a portal to and from Nowhere, a small
plane of existence about the size of a two-story mansion. It is featureless,
its walls are indestructible, and it always has fresh air. If the key relocks
the door, the door returns to normal and it opens up to its normal destination.
Nowhere can't be locked from the inside, and only one portal to Nowhere can
exist at a time.

**According to legend...**

* This key spontaneously came into existence when someone finished crafting
  Nowhere. The question is, who built Nowhere?
* Nowhere was originally the home of the first wizard, who created the universe
  because he got tired of his cramped living quarters.
* Nowhere is the true universe. The universe we know is basically just
  Nowhere's backyard. 

### Null Equation
Discovering the variables necessary to solve this extremely complicated
equation is typically an epic undertaking. Once the equation is solved, the
solver can subtract something from the universe. However, the final equation
simplifies to "Null = Existence - 2X," meaning that the equation always
subtracts double what is intended. The GM decides what else is subtracted from
the universe.

**According to legend...**

* Students at an arcane academy discovered this equation scrawled on a single
  sheet of paper in an empty, featureless room. Apparently, whoever wrote down
  the equation had been subtracted from the universe.
* Scholars are still trying to solve for its inverse equation, which would
  allow mathemagicians to calculate things into existence.
* One of the unknown variables represents divinity. If the symbol is found and
  used, the null equation could delete the universe.

### Stubbs' Dog Collar
Any animal who wears this collar functions as a familiar as per the Arcane
trait Call Familiar, loyally serving whoever placed the collar on it.

**According to legend...**

* As her last act of true love, a dying wizard gave this gift to her beloved
  husband so that he could watch over her familiar, Stubbs, after she passed.
* A mistreated apprentice knew that he could never hope to defeat his master,
  so he created this collar and ran off with his master's familiar as a petty
  act of revenge.
* Placing this collar on a person causes splitting headaches and eventually
  brain damage.

### Talia's Eternal Blade
The sword is surprisingly light and it floats on water. It is utterly and
completely indestructible, no matter what&ndash;not even the GM can destroy
this weapon.

**According to legend...**

* Talia was a vain chronomancer who forged this weapon during her fruitless
  quest to unlock eternal youth.
* This weapon was created by cosmic entities, who used it to slice apart
  reality into its component dimensions.
* Talia, an apprentice swordmage, botched a dangerous teleportation spell.
  Talia vanished from existence, but her sword (or at least this version of it)
  appeared at her teleportation destination.

## Artifice
### Abyss's Heart, powerful bow
**Lore:** The Abyss's Heart is the gargantuan longbow favored by the Deep Giant
Hewl Three-eye, slayer of Eld the Falseheart. Eld was a terrible deep giant
king who was infamous for his totalitarian, isolationist reign. Shortly into
his reign, he closed the Gates of Darkness for the first time in six hundred
years, cutting off the only entrance to the once bustling Deep Giant city of
Ocean's Hollow. Hewl feltthe sadness and confusion of his people and escaped
the city to swim the old currents. He did not stop for four days, as was the
custom of his people were questing, and on that allotted rest day he was woken
by a tickling on his stomach. Tree-Oyster, a gnomish artificer who had survived
a shipwreck, had mistaken Hewl for a small barren island and climbed on him for
safety. Hewl agreed to deliver Tree-Oyster to his workshop. In return,
Tree-Oyster vowed to help Hewl free his people. Having safely returned to his
home, Tree-Oyster began work immediately on a weapon that could defeat the
cruel king Eld. He used the trunk of a petrified tree to form the limbs of the
bow. Then for twelve days without rest, as is custom among gnomes who are
inventing, he and Hewl wove the bowstring from blades of irongrass found in the
forest. With Hewl's help, Tree Oyster then strung the bow and they marveled at
the ten-foot-tall masterpiece. After a light dinner, Tree-Oyster then performed
three important enchantments on the bow. With these enchantments woven, Hewl
bid farewell to his new friend and returned to Ocean's Hollow to complete his
quest.

**Properties:** The first enchantmentallows the bow to shrink down to any size
so that Hewl could restring it more easily. Information on the second
enchantment has been lost, except that it once saved Hewl's life. The third
enchantment transforms the bow into a seaworthy ship large enough to transport
two giants.

### Bottomless Bag, weak bag
**Lore:** Bags of holding have been around for so long that nobody is exactly
sure who came up with the first one. Was it a clever smuggler? A rich merchant?
A bored archmage? Whoever it was, he invented a magic item that is commonly
used the world over.

**Properties:** This container holds much more than would normally be
possible&ndash;just how much is up to the GM. If this container is ever turned
inside out, its magic is forever lost and it becomes a normal item.


### Electric Fly, weak automoton
**Lore:** Electric flies are minuscule, spherical metal constructs. They earned
their name due to their erratic flight patterns and their tendency to annoy
people with their ceaseless buzzing. Sensible people just use toolbelts to
carry around their tools. Gadgeteers and magic item enchanters are rarely quite
so traditional. Many magical craftsmen create Electric Flies, which busily buzz
around workshops, performing minor tasks for their creators. It's not uncommon
to see an enchanter hunched over a workbench with a half dozen electric flies
hovering around him, an obscure arcane tool hanging from each of their tiny
hooks.

**Properties:** Electric flies have flawless flight, allowing them to hover in
place. They can follow simple commands such as "Go here," "Find this person,"
or "Hold this candle." Each Electric Fly has a tiny hook on its bottom,
allowing it to carry a payload of about 5 pounds.

### Fusion Fingers, legendary gloves
**Lore:** This pair of metal gloves seems to be made of blazing, molten gold.
Once upon a time, there were ten suns. They all rose at once, so no one among
them need be lonely. A brave heroine shot down nine before they could burn the
earth, and from then on the lonely sun sits in the sky, by itself,
forevermore.Once upon a time, nine suns fell from the sky and crashed to earth,
cracking their shells like eggs. Molten golden blood streamed from their
corpses, blinding all who would look upon it. The blood streamed across the
world, forming a great river-belt that spanned its circumference. None could
live near it. The earth and stone spirits made the great scaly hide of the
world rise and fall, until the sun eggs and its still-streaming blood were
hidden beneath the surface, becoming the planet's core. And it is because the
blood mixed with the mud of the earth that you do not go blind when you look
upon gold.Once upon a time, there was a smith unlike any you have ever seen or
ever will. And she could not see you either, for the smith was born blind. But
the smith knew gold and orichalcum to her soul; touching and smelling and
tasting and hearing these metals was enough for her to make wonders. The smith
found one of the sun-eggs, and made from them a wondrous set of gloves with the
power to make anything from everything. The smith made eyes for herself, to her
regret. And so it was that the smith spent the last years of her life in
madness and sickness, as she put young eyes into an old body.Once upon a time,
there were two miraculous gloves. Men killed each other for them. Kingdoms were
lost to own the set. Empires crumbled under their influence.Once upon a time,
an adventurer found the gloves. The rest of this story? Well, those parts are
up to you.

**Properties:** When worn, the touch of the left glove will reduce any
non-living substance to its base matter (typically reducing the object to a
lump of clay-like sludge.) The right glove can turn base materials into
anything, so long as you can mold the object with only one hand.

### Heart Gem, powerful circlet
**Lore:** One night, the legendary sculptor Myssia awoke from a dream with a
clear image of her masterpiece. She immediately purchased a block of marble and
set to work, lovingly chipping away at the stone to reveal her vision. She
became obsessed with her work, ignoring a mile-long line of suitors in favor of
working on her sculpture. She claimed that she was too busy for marriage, but
her secret was that she was slowly falling in love with her sculpture. Decades
passed, and she finally completed Young Man Drawing Water from a Well, an
absolute masterpiece. The already-famous sculptor became a household name as
people flocked from miles around to behold her work of art, but it didn't
matter to Myssia. She fell into crushing depression because the one man she
ever loved could never love her back. She spent her twilight years working on a
secretive project behind closed doors. When she was old and withered, she
emerged from her workshop with a glittering golden circlet and placed it on her
statue's head. The statue man of Young Man Drawing Water from a Well came to
life, and the two shared a single passionate kiss before Myssia passed away.

**Properties:** When this circlet (or any other piece of jewelry containing
this gem) is placed on a statue, the statue comes to life. Removing the circlet
returns the statue to normal. 

### Mirror Shield, weak shield
**Lore:** This round, silver shield has been polished to a mirror-like sheen.
In some cultures, honor duels are a very serious matter. So when a young
blacksmith insulted a powerful archmage by bumping into him on the street,
everybody knew that the blacksmith had written his own death sentence. The
blacksmith knew he had no chance of defeating the archmage in single combat, so
he crafted a shield that would turn the archmage's own spells against him. His
plan utterly failed. The archmage took one look at the shield and immediately
deduced that it had some sort of reflective power, so he simply conjured a
cloud of poisonous gas that choked the blacksmith to death. The archmage kept
the shield as a trophy and as a reminder to keep secret weapons secret.

**Properties:** If the wielder is the only target of a ranged attack, they can
spend 1 advantage to reflect the attack back to the attacker.

### Multi-faceted Goggles, powerful goggles
**Lore:** A famous articer received a strange request to construct a miniscule
music box that could fit on the head of a nail, but would still be loud enough
to entertain a ballroom full of people. Much to his surprise, building the
music box wasn't all that difficult -- in fact, he had to spend more time
building specialized tools for the project than he did on the music box itself.
He spent more than half of his commission money perfecting a pair of goggles
that would allow him to see the tiny music box. When the music box was
finished, the goggles became the artificer's new obsession.

**Properties:** The goggles have a series of lenses, which can be slipped in
front of the eyepieces. Only one lense can be active at a time, and switching
them is an action. The lenses grant the following to the wearer:

* **Red Lens:** Infrared vision
* **Green Lens:** Microscopic vision
* **Blue Lens:** Telescopic vision
* **Purple Lens:** X-ray vision

### Pitwick's ABV, powerful mount
**Lore:** Pitwick the artificer hated animals. And why shouldn't he!? They
bite, they're dumb as bricks, and they shit everywhere. His job as an
adventurer meant that he had to spend far more time with animals than he would
have liked, riding flea-riden horses and feeding stubborn packbeasts. When a
horse kicked him in the chest and broke one of his ribs, enough was enough.
Pitwick fried the horse with his lightning gun and set about inventing an All
Biome Vehicle, a mechanical mount.

**Properties:** This mount can comfortably hold two people. It has a top speed
that's twice as fast as a horse, all-terrain capabilities, and built-in air
conditioning. 

### Skullcrusher, legendary hammer
**Lore:** Warlord Thuzurosh Deathbleeder waged bloody war against his foes,
leaving a path of carnage and ash as he marched to conquer the world. It was
said that he used his bloodthirsty warmaul Skullcrusher to crush the skulls of
well over a thousand troops. Thuzurosh eventually met his end at the hands of a
brave young knight. As Thuzurosh lay dying, the knight promised to undo all the
destruction Thuzurosh had wrought. He took the dead warlord's hammer and used
it to lead the reconstruction efforts. The knight mocked the warlord's legacy
by transforming the feared weapon of carnage into an instrument of hope and
unity. 

**Properties:** One smack from this hammer instantly repairs anything (it
doesn't heal damage, though). 

### Sonic Wrench, powerful wrench
**Lore:** Left behind by a bizarre interstellar clockwork robot known only as
"The Mechanic," the functions of this omni-tool are as bizarre and mysterious
as its origins.

**Properties:** This device functions as virtually any tool or device
imaginable.

## Bardic Lore
### Apparel Gem, weak gemstone
**Lore:** Apparel Gems resemble various fake precious stones. Long ago, a
merchant was delighted by a troupe of traveling entertainers. The merchant
marveled over their acrobatic performances, their sleight of hand tricks, and
their bawdy jokes. He was particularly tickled by the bards' plays and would
spend hours watching the talented group perform. Eventually, the merchant
commissioned an enchanter to create the world's first Apparel Gems, which
allowed the performers to quickly change costumes between play scenes. It
wasn't long before Apparel Gem knockoffs began popping up throughout the city.
The gems' practical magic proved popular for people from all walks of life:
soldiers stored their heavy armor in them during long marches, spies hid
disguises in the gems, and noblewomen stored a variety of fashionable
accessories in the gems so that they could change their appearance at whim.

**Properties:** The gem can hold an entire suit of clothing&ndash;from a full
suit of plate armor to a single sock. The wielder simply needs to hold the gem
and say a command word (typically "fill" or "empty") to either compress an
article of clothing into the gem or to eject the article of clothing out of it.

### Echo, weak bottle
**Lore:** This simple glass bottle appears to be empty. At first touch,
however, it is immediately clear that this bottle is not as it seems. The
surface vibrates slightly, as if resonating from a loud noise. A skilled bard
hoped to unlock the secrets of song by studying the music of sea sirens. The
only problem was that he couldn't listen to their captivating music without
falling under their spell. So, he did the next best thing: he convinced an air
elemental to take up residence in a small glass bottle. With the bottle in tow,
the bard plugged his ears and recorded the sirens' song so that he could later
study their haunting melody in safety.

**Properties:** The bottle records sound at all times. The owner can uncork the
bottle to have it play back any sound that it has recorded.

### Spellsight Cowl, weak cowl
**Lore:** This is a simple leather cowl made of supple brown leather. It is
connected in the front with a silver clasp fashioned to look like an open eye
with the phrase "See, and Know" inscribed in draconic runes in the eye's pupil.
With solemn care and tremendous sadness, the faculty and students of the
Alatzen Arcane Academy buried Savris the Sage. Savris was beloved by students
and revered by his peers for his insight into Arcane magic. Unbeknownst to all
of them, the archwizard they had buried wasn't Savris at all, but a bard by the
name of Vissar. Decades before, the young gambler had cheated at a game of
cards and ended up with an enchanter indebted to him. Vissar had the enchanter
create this cowl thinking that he could use it to pickpocket magic items from
unwary mages. He was spotted by the first mage he attempted to rob, so he
quickly told a lie. Vissar explained that he recognized the magic item (he had
used the cowl's magic to identify the item) and simply wanted a closer look.
The mage was impressed that a commoner knew so much about magic, so they
started talking. Vissar (who quickly came up with the alias "Savris") stunned
the mage with his insight of magic items and spells. In reality, Vissar was
simply describing the magic that the cowl allowed him to see. The mage invited
Vissar to make a presentation at the nearby academy. A few dozen clever lies
later, Vissar had secured tenure at the wizardry school. He didn't know a
single spell (and he never bothered to learn), but his ability to read magic
made him appear like a genius to his colleagues. Vissar, otherwise known as
Savris the Sage, taught at the academy for 46 years until he passed away. A
statue dedicated to the Sage can still be found on the grounds of the Alatzen
Arcane Academy.

**Properties:** Whenever the wearer sees a spell or magic item, the GM must
tell him an interesting, relevant fact about it.

### Well-Wishing Whiskey, weak alcohol
**Lore:** This whiskey has a smooth finish and a warm, golden scent. This
whiskey is distilled from an ancient wishing well that grants people luck when
drunk. It is especially popular among students at the Wizard Academy during
exam time.

**Properties:** When a group of people propose a toast and drink a round of
this whiskey, the drinkers become imbued with good luck. Each drinker can
increase a single roll that relates to the toast within the next day or so.

## Beast
### Bird Figurine: Crow Pinions, weak figurine
**Lore:** The Crow Pinion is a small dirty wooden figurine, that of a
crudely-shaped blackbird. Its eyes are glass gems, pupiless; gazing into them
feels like falling into an ocean's black depths. In its tail is a hole, through
which one may string a lanyard or band. When you hold it to your ear, you can
hear the faint beating of a heart. Nobody knows where the Crow Pinion came
from; you hear it may have drifted down from the far North. It has some magic
in it, but without its enchantment the figurine is worthless.

**Properties:** You have safe fall 10. The wooden bird animates in the presence
of fresh meat, and will attempt to feed. When it eats enough (GM's discretion),
it transforms into the magic item Magpie Feathers.

### Bird Figurine: Magpie Feathers, weak figurine
**Lore:** The Magpie Feathers take the shape of two leather wrist-bands, both
set with plumes of black feathers. At your command, they transform into a long
pair of silky shining black wings, twice as long as a man's arm. In your pocket
is a crudely-carved blackbird's head, which resembles a raven. The former
wooden figurine swooped down at your moment of need, gripped its little talons
onto your back, and grew into its new shape.

**Properties:** You have safe fall 15. When you speak the word "Up", you can
glide. The bird's head sings to you when you move in the direction of the
Temple of Simurgh. If you reach the temple and overcome its challenges, the
figurine transforms into the magic item Rook Talons.

### Mark of the Spider, weak figurine
**Lore:** This metallic figurine of a spider is roughly 3 inches in diameter.
Its body has red streaks, and the legs are thin and black. This strange item
was unearthed in the ruins of what historians believe was a cult's temple. The
exact origin of the figurine have been lost to history, but the vivid
hieroglyphs etched into the ruins might shed light on the mystery. The
hieroglyphs tell the vivid story of a hero who was blessed by a spider goddess.
The hero eventually violated the most sacred dogma of the spider goddess, so
the goddess physically ripped her blessing from the hero's body. 

**Properties:** When placed on a person and left undisturbed for several
seconds, the figurine will animate and bite the person. For about a day, the
recipient of the bite will have a tattoo of a spider appear somewhere on their
body. Their skin will feel tingly, and may choose to have whatever touches
their skin adhere to it until they choose to release it. Increase rolls to
maintain grapples. The user may climb walls in this way.

### Bird Figurine: Rook Talons, powerful figurine
**Lore:** The Rook Talons take the shape of a pair of moccasin-styled shoes,
patterned with stylized clutched talons. At your wish, a set of black-feathered
wings materialize under your arms, and an articulated pair of steel-toed boots
over your feet. Mounted on the big and small toes are two very long and
articulated curved claws, and curved spurs on your heels. In your pocket is a
crudely-carved blackbird's head. Set in its wooden head are two dark grey eyes,
with black irises. The Magpie Feathers led you to a temple dedicated to the
Simurgh. After braving some of its dangers, you were rewarded with clawed
shoes, which allowed the Magpie Feathers to evolve into its third form. You
don't know what the bird's plans are, or what will happen when the journey is
complete.

**Properties:** You have safe fall 20. After you sing the 34th Hymn of the
Blackbird (work with the GM to determine what that is), you can fly and and
hold items with the talons on your feet. The bird's head now speaks in
monosyllables, and finds many inane things funny. Sometimes, when it falls
silent, tears swell in its eyes. When you sleep, you dream of reaching a
mountain at the roof of the world&ndash;taller than anything else&ndash;and
leaping from its summit. If you do so, the item transforms into the magic item
Jackdaw's Beak.

### Bird Figurine: Jackdaw's Beak, powerful figurine
**Lore:** The Jackdaw's Beak takes the shape of a ebon fabric belt, with an
oversized brass buckle. Worked into the metal is a stylized bird's head. At
your will, a soft suit of feathery scales envelops your body. Over your head is
a helmet shaped like a beak. Two arm's length in span are your black wings, and
you may retract them whenever you wish. The raven head at the belt buckle
speaks with a soft, silvery voice, and asks that you call it "Corax." Jumping
off the Mountain of Neverwas and flying to safety caused Corax to rediscover
its voice and its intelligence. It is now a boon companion of yours. It
promises you the power of a very specific god, found in an impossible place,
attained only after accomplishing seven impossible things before the day's
first meal.

**Properties:** The armor that appears at your command acts as light armor. You
have safe fall 25. When you feel the laughing wind deep in your heart and speak
its name, you can fly with no limits to your maneuverability and hold items
with the talons attached to your feet. Increase all rolls you make to snatch
items with your feet. Corax is an intelligent, erudite, and witty companion,
and may be at times somewhat coarse and childish. If you complete seven
impossible things before your day's first meal (the GM decides what that
means), the item transforms into the magic item The Raven.

### Many-Sided Coin, powerful coin
**Lore:** This golden coin shows an animal on each side. A king under the
attack of a much greater force requested advice from the wisest men and women
of his kingdom. The combined efforts of his blacksmith and the village sensai
resulted in a unique coin that could fill its wielder with the power of a great
beast. The king ordered that his mages and blacksmiths forge hundreds of these
coins and distribute them to his soldiers, each coin bearing a different
animal. Despite the help of this unique tool, the invaders overwhelmed the army
and slayed the king.And to the victor go the spoils. The leader of the invading
force gathered all of the coins from the dead soldiers and melted them down to
form a single, all-powerful coin.

**Properties:** The coin shows an animal on each side. Whenever the user flips
the coin, they become infused with the power of whatever animal landed face-up
for several hours. It's up to the GM to decide how that power manifests (extra
finesse from a cat, the ability to breathe water from a fish, the ability to
roar like a lion, etc). Then, both faces on the coin change to show a different
pair of animals. These bonuses don't stack. The coin contains hundreds,
possibly even thousands of natural and supernatural creatures, so it's rare for
a user to see the same animal more than once.

### Bird Figurine: The Raven, legendary figurine
**Lore:** The Raven return to its form of a small, crudely-shaped wooden
figurine of a blackbird, with a hole around its tail to hold its leather cord.
When you raise it to your ear, you can hear the strong and steady heartbeat of
someone who has found itself.When you clutch the Raven in your hand, muster
your intent, and speak the word "Fly," you become one with the Raven, its
feathers merging with your flesh in a glorious and mystical transformation.
Your plumage is soft like black velvet. Your wing feathers are a bright and
glossy obsidian. Your full wingspan touches the edges of creation. Your black
eyes can lead you wherever you want to go. You are the trickster-god reborn,
but also yourself. Finally reunited with itself, the Raven makes it known that
it was once a divine trickster with plumage of pure white, who fooled the gods.
But What-Would-Be-Raven tricked the Titans into investing their power into the
sun, the moon, and the stars. When the titans realized they had been weakened,
the angry giants cut What-Would-Be-Raven into five pieces and threw the remains
at the sun, scorching its feathers pitch-black.Now that you have all five
pieces, the figurine sighs, and tells you that it is tired of life as a
fragment. It wishes to be whole again, and asks that you serve as it's avatar,
its binding agent, it's vessel.If you would accept, you gain this legendary
magical item, and some long-forgotten divine authority. If you refuse,
What-Is-Now-Jackdaw deems that suicide is better than living in splinters, and
flies into the sun to burn one last time.

**Properties:** Becoming the Raven, you instantly succeed with grand style any
roll that involves snatching away something from someone. You will never take
falling damage, no matter how high you fall. You can out-speed, out-maneuver,
and out-fly anything that travels trough the sky, with absolutely no effort at
all. You can survive any environment.

## Command
### Helm of Oleg Thunderspeaker, powerful helmet
**Lore:** Oleg was not a good fighter. Born with a crooked spine and bad legs,
he could have easily died young and alone. Luckily, what he lacked in physical
strength he more than made up for with a booming voice. He initially gained
mild local fame by singing battle hymns before landing a spot at the right hand
of his clan's grand general. Whenever a scuffle would break out near Oleg's
mountain home, he would stand near the peak of the mountain and bellow down the
general's orders to the troops below. For decades, soldiers swore that Oleg's
commands sounded like thunder had learned to speak.

**Properties:** When the wearer speaks from on high, their voice travels for
miles and thunderclouds gather.

### Wrath of the Fallen Conqueror: Hateful Helmet, weak helmet
**Lore:** This bronze helmet shows the visage of grotesquely detailed face
(multitudes of scars, bulging eyes, crooked teeth, etc). Long ago, an army
stood as the last line of defense against a warlord bent on conquering the
world. The army succeeded, but the wrath of the conqueror was too great to
vanish into the afterlife. Fragments of his spirit spilled into tools of war
that littered the bloody battlefield.This helmet contains the conqueror's
spirit&ndash;his ability to size up an enemy.Legend has it that if a single
person wields all 3 items, the conqueror will be reborn.

**Properties:** At the start of each combat, the wearer can select a creature.
The GM must reveal one of the creature's qualities.

### Radiant Dawn / Twilight Crown, powerful helmet
**Lore:** This mutable helmet's only constant feature is a silver crown, cut to
resemble suns rising and setting over mountains. When touched by the first
light of dawn, the helmet becomes platinum and shines with a soft light. When
the dark of night sweeps over it, the crown becomes cold, polished obsidian.
Hedbarog, a fierce and mighty queen, ruled the Grey Keep, the first bastion
between civilisation and the demon caverns of Bolboroth. Each day, she led her
troops against the forces of evil that boiled from the cold heart of the earth.
Each night, she kept vigilant watch against their insurgence. Her devotion
inspired an ancient spirit, who granted her immortality so long as she held her
keep against the terrors of the night. His gift came in the form of a platinum
helmet whose mere presence uplifted the soul and strengthened the arm.
Hedbarog's immortality allowed her to amass great power and her watch against
the demon hordes soon became an extermination. As the Grey Keep's need for
protection lessened, Hedbarog began to age again, her work almost done.
Terrified of the ravages of time, she devised a plan to introduce new terrors
for the wardens of the Grey Keep to battle. By night, she raised the forces of
evil up again to crash against the keep's walls, and by day she stood atop its
walls and rained death on her nocturnal allies. But the spirit's gift was soon
corrupted and Hedbarog's power left her, consumed by the greed that had gripped
her heart. All that remained was the helmet, sustained by the pure magic of the
spirit and the fearful will of Hedbarog.

**Properties:** When touched by the light of a dawning sun, the helmet becomes
Radiant Dawn. It glows softly. All those who see it know its owner to be good
and true and the forces of good will be attracted to its benevolent power. It
causes yourself and allies within a far distance to be immune to terror. When
touched by starlight, the helmet becomes the Twilight Crown. All who see it
know its owner to be cruel and wicked and the forces of evil will be attracted
to its malevolent power. When the wielder critically hits with an attack, he
terrifies the target for 1d6 turns.

### Wrath of the Fallen Conqueror: Bloody Bastion, powerful shield
**Lore:** The Bloody Bastion is a heavy shield, pointed at the base with a
crown of spikes at the top. The shield is several feet tall and has a frame of
wrought iron. The back of the shield is a smooth piece of metal marred only by
the handles. When it is active, the shield's front warps and splinters into
wooden arms. Between the arms is an ominous black hole that boils with raw
hatred. Long ago, an army stood as the last line of defense against a warlord
bent on conquering the world. The army succeeded, but the wrath of the
conqueror was too great to vanish into the afterlife. Fragments of his spirit
spilled into tools of war that littered the bloody battlefield.This shield
contains the conqueror's mind&ndash;his insatiable bloodlust. Legend has it
that if a single person wields all 3 items, the conqueror will be reborn.

**Properties:** When the wielder defeats a creature, the shield animates and
devours the defeated creature's body. The defeated is dead forever, period.

### Wrath of the Fallen Conqueror: Avenging Axe, legendary axe
**Lore:** This gnarled battle axe has a notched, blood-stained edge. Long ago,
an army stood as the last line of defense against a warlord bent on conquering
the world. The army succeeded, but the wrath of the conqueror was too great to
vanish into the afterlife. Fragments of his spirit spilled into tools of war
that littered the bloody battlefield.This axe contains the conqueror's
body&ndash;his godlike strength.Legend has it that if a single person wields
all 3 items, the conqueror will be reborn.

**Properties:** When the Avenging Axe rings with the shouts of a thousand dying
men, the blows of a roaring army, or the full force of nature's fury, it will
grant its bearer the ability to perform one feat of strength on par with
cleaving a mountain in twain.

## Dragon
### The Arbiter, powerful sword
**Lore:** This long iron blade that has been tempered in dragon's breath,
giving it a crimson sheen. The hilt and handle are crafted out of dragon bone.
Red shimmering scales cover the sheath of the blade. Even the mightiest dragons
have to start their treasure hoard somewhere. One young red dragon made the
fatal mistake of targeting a small kingdom to the north&ndash;he challenged the
kingdom's greatest champion to a deathmatch, and was promptly cut down. The
champion forged this sword from the dragon's corpse to let all other dragon's
know: this land is protected.

**Properties:** The wielder can do all of the following:

* Detect and be detected by dragons within 10 miles.
* Telepathically communicate with dragons within this range.
* Roll +3 damage die against dragons.
* Terrify dragons damaged by this blade. Resisting.

## Elements
### Blast Stones, weak stones
**Lore:** These are rough, grey stones with slightly glowing red hairline
cracks. Blast stone ore was first discovered in the Dwarven Ordukr Mines. The
miners initially thought the strange glowing veins were a new type of gemstone
and eagerly began mining it. When the miners struck the vein with their
pickaxes, however, the ore exploded and caused a disastrous cave-in. Since
then, miners take considerable care when extracting blast stones. Mining blast
stones is incredibly dangerous, but the popularity of blast stones among
militarily forces and adventurers ensures that there will always be a high
demand for this highly unstable stone.

**Properties:** When blast stones experience a sharp impact, it explodes and
deals damage to everything in a blast centered on its space. The damage dealt
depends on the size of a blast stone. A handheld stone about the size of an
apple deals 1d12 damage. An entire barrel full of blast stone ore could
potentially be enough to destroy an entire castle wall.

### Lightning Bolt, weak crossbow Bolt
**Lore:** This humble crossbow bolt is made of weathered metal. The head of the
bolt is jagged, like a lightning bolt. Amused by his own clever pun, a storm
mage enchanted this crossbow bolt with the fury of a thunderstorm.

**Properties:** When the bolt hits something, it unleashes a loud thunderclap
that sounds identical to real thunder. The sound can be heard for miles in all
directions if it's used in the open air. All creatures in a blast centered on
the point of impact are deafened for about 1 day.

### Splashdown, weak arrow
**Lore:** These arrows have shafts made of hard coral and sharp seashells for
heads. These arrows were created by the merfolk specifically for underwater
use. Over the years, the merfolk have perfected their design with liquid
propulsion magic.

**Properties:** When fired underwater, the arrow flies like a normal arrow
would over land. When fired in open air, it spurts out water and changes
directions erratically.

### Seabringer, legendary trident
**Lore:** This trident is roughly 6 feet in length with a handle of dark wood
and three prongs of red iron. In the beginning, the planet was a barren
wasteland full of hot ash and lakes of lava. Some primordial entity (scholars
still debate whether it was a god, a titan, or some other cosmic force) struck
the earth with the Seabringer. Instantly, the haze of ash that blanketed the
planet transformed into rain clouds, thus beginning a years-long storm that
filled the planet with endless oceans.

**Properties:** Plunging the Seabringer into the earth causes a catastrophic
hurricane centered on that spot. The storm will continue for several days and
cause extreme flooding. The storm actually summons water from elsewhere in the
universe, so every use of this trident permanently increases the planet's sea
level by a few inches.

## Faith
### Eye See, weak bow
**Lore:** Eye See is made of human bone; that fact alone tends to unsettle
people. Then there are the smiling and winking faces inscribed in rings on the
grip. Bowyers look at Eye See with disbelief; human bone has nowhere near the
tensile strength or flexibility to bend the way a bow needs. And yet, it does.
Eye See's arrow-heads are concavo-convexes, within each carved a glyph of a
heavily-lidded eye in the midst of blinking. Once, there was a seer known as
Seimoor. Seimoor was an asshole; she drank, chased skirt, kicked people for no
good reason before running away, and she generally only used her foresight for
trivial things like betting on horseraces and making lewd jokes. When blight
and extinction came to the land by way of the Second Sun, Seimoor went to the
Lady Knights and told them to kill her and make bows and arrows of her bones.
She had foreseen their coming quest, and knew that her powers would be a great
boon to them. When asked why Seimoor couldn't just come with them, she
professed a childhood dream of becoming a bow. Not an archer or a fletcher;
just a bow. Many profess that when she laid her head on the chopping block,
Seimoor grinned. The asshole.

**Properties:** When someone fires one of Eye See's arrows (with the bow), he
immediately goes temporarily blind. Within a split second, his vision is
replaced by that of the glyph in the arrow as it speeds to its location. When
the arrow stops, the shooter's vision returns to normal instantaneously. The
bow comes with 2d6 arrows, which can be recovered after they've been fired.

### Lightbringer, weak longsword
**Lore:** The pommel of this sword resembles a golden sun, with the rays of
light extending left and right to create the hilt. A longer sun ray stretches
downward to form the grip, and the longest ray streaks outward to form the
cruel edge of this golden longsword. The Temple of Dawn strove relentlessly to
banish the world of evil creatures that lurk in the shadows. The members of the
church performed their duties exceedingly well, so much so that they attracted
the ire of a powerful group of vampires. Late one night, the vampires
infiltrated the temple and slaughtered the sleeping inhabitants. They then set
the temple ablaze in one final cruel act before retreating into the darkness.
The priests' golden holy symbols melted in the heat of the flames and gathered
into a mass of molten gold as bright and hot as the sun itself. When the sun
crested the next morning, the Lightbringer was born among the ashes of the
fallen temple.

**Properties:** The wielder can have the blade emit light as bright as a torch.
The light counts as sunlight.

### Unbroken Flail, powerful flail
**Lore:** The haft and the spiked head of this flail are wrought of black iron.
The chain is made of some sort of silvery, unidentifiable metal. Long ago, a
powerful angel passed judgment on an ancient evil, condemning it to 1000 years
of imprisonment for a heinous crime. The angel constructed an unbreakable chain
to bind the foul creature, and for a full millennium the chain fulfilled its
purpose. The angel valued justice above all else, so he was forced to release
the ancient evil after it had served its term. The legend doesn't state what
happened to the angel or the ancient evil, but for unknown reasons that
unbreakable chain somehow found its way into mortal hands. It now serves a
similar purpose, helping adventurers lock away powerful evil entities.

**Properties:** The chain of this flail is unbreakable. When you make a Very
good attack against a creature with this weapon, it can't move for 1d6 turns.

## Martial
### Scroll of Grasping Iron Eagle Talon, powerful scroll
**Lore:** The exotic symbols on this long, thin scroll detail the Grasping Iron
Eagle Talons technique. The only problem is that the scroll language has been
lost as well, so its secrets are forever sealed away in obscurity.

**Properties:** This scroll is thin and long like a bandage, which enables it
to be wrapped around a person's hand. If that hand is used to grab onto
something, absolutely nothing can break that grip unless the user chooses to
break it.

## Nature
### Rainkeeper's Staff, weak staff
**Lore:** This wooden staff is nearly identical to a length of driftwood. Its
dark color and cracked surface suggests that it is several hundred years old,
at least. Druidic runes cover its surface, with the rune for "Purity" etched
near the bottom. When the staff is near water, the runes begin to glow a pale
yellow. One of the most popular druidic legends is the tale of Purity, a
beautiful maiden of the forest and one of the first true druids. As a young
girl, she saw the unparalleled beauty of nature and felt within herself a need
to protect it. As she grew older, she found that plants would react to her
presence, and that she could calm the rage of any beast. It is said that she
pulled the staff from a knot in a great tree and traveled the world teaching
people to revere nature and its gifts.To this day, druids teach that Purity
ascended after death to become a spirit of nature. Her name now represents one
of the fundamental tenants of druidism: man is guest in the house of nature,
and to sully it is an ultimate disrespect.

**Properties:** This staff will purify any water into which it is placed.
Impure water is drawn up through one end and will flow from the other, free of
any toxins, magical or otherwise.

## Occultism
### Eye of Night, weak gemstone
**Lore:** The Eye of Night is an oval-shaped stone made from the darkest
obsidian. The color is the purest black, and the glossy surface reflects light
like a mirror. The reflections are strangely distorted, as it seems to reflect
shadows rather than light. In the same way that a person can fall sick from a
dark plague, so too can a ray of light become infected by shadow. This is what
happened with the Eye of Night&ndash;a sunbeam was corrupted by shadow when it
struck a dark obsidian rock. The stone absorbed the light and twisted its warm,
golden rays into cold shadow.

**Properties:** This is an obsidian stone that is about the size of a human
eye. The possessor of the gem has the colors of his eyes inverted (black to
white and white to black). He sees light and dark in reverse&ndash;he sees dark
areas as if they were well lit and illuminated areas if they were dark and
shadowy.

### Blooddrinker, legendary sword
**Lore:** This curved blade has a slight red tint to it. The blade is serrated
with cruel barbs. The black-red iron seems to pulse with an unnatural hunger.
Living things have trace amounts of iron in their blood. When a cruel demon
lord discovered this fact, he immediately set about collecting enough bloodiron
to craft a blade. He had to drain countless bodies&ndash;thousands, possibly
even millions. Forged in a sea of boiling blood, Blooddrinker exists only to
consume the blood of the living.

**Properties:** Creatures with blood that are damaged by this weapon bleed,
which doesn't stop until the affected creature loses all of its life. The blade
is sentient and endlessly bloodthirsty. If the wielder does not satisfy the
blade's thirst for blood, it will cause the wielder to bleed.

## Psionics
### Adorinel, the Legacy Circlet, weak circlet
**Lore:** This silver circlet is made out of hundreds, possibly thousands of
interwoven strands of hair-thin silver. The strands gather at the front of the
circlet to create a symmetrical, organized, yet incredibly complicated knot. An
elven community was struck by a terrible plague that gradually turned the
infected insane. It was an affliction of the mind, so young psion Casrae
Starheart was the only one who wasn't affected. She watched in horror as her
friends and family became sicker and sicker before eventually descending into
madness. With no cure available, Casrae resolved to preserve the minds of her
kin: she took a masterfully crafted elven circlet and infused it with her
psionic energy to create a holding device for conscious minds. She then placed
the circlet on each villager. Even though they would soon devolve into madness,
the collective knowledge of Casrae's people would be forever stored in
Adorinel, which means "legacy" in elvish.

**Properties:** Anyone who wears this circlet immediately has his mind copied
and uploaded into the circlet. This doesn't affect the wearer in any way. Each
day, the circlet randomly selects one of the minds stored in the circlet. The
wearer of the circlet can telepathically communicate with that mind. There are
hundreds of minds currently stored in the circlet, each one with a distinct
personality and knowledge specialty.

## Savagery
### Bleeding Cloak, weak cloak
**Lore:** The creases of this gruesome leather cloak occasionally ooze blood. A
great soldier returned home and found that his family had been mutilated by
savages while he was away. In a state of blinding rage, he found those
responsible and tore the flesh from their bones. The rest can only be assumed.

**Properties:** The wearer has 5 soak. Submerging the cloak in blood overnight
regenerates lost soak.

### Blade of Cursed Rituals, powerful dagger
**Lore:** This weapon is a carefully carved stone knife, stained permanently
with blood. A dull, far-off drumming is heard whenever it is held. The drums
have started again. From my hiding place, I can hear everything--the crackle of
the bonfire, the chanting, and the cries of those soon to be killed. I tremble
as the words come into focus. They're calling my name. A scaled hand pulls away
the cloth that hides me and yanks me out, the Shaman offering me up for the
crowd's inspection.The din of the Saurek rises to a crescendo as they lay their
slitted eyes on me, and I am certain that my time has come. There are a hundred
Saurek in the crowd, but I care not for them. Atop an altar before me,
squirming in vain against his bindings, is their sacrifice.The Shaman lifts me
high above the altar, and I can feel a hundred and one pairs of eyes upon me.
He plunges me down. The sacrifice is made. I thirst for more.

**Properties:** This sentient blade is cruel, vain, and bloodthirsty. It
communicates to its wielder through emotional impulses and drum-like beating,
often increasing the sound of drum beats to a feverish intensity when it is
about to spill blood. The dagger has the rending keyword for free. When the
blade takes the life of a worthy creature, attacks made with it roll +1 damage
die, stacking. However, each stack makes the wielder increasingly bloodthirsty.
Washing the blood from the blade ends both effects.

### Scabbard of Boling the Pummeler, weak scabbard
**Lore:** Barbarians have never been known for their manners. So when Bolin the
Barbarian was hungry, he killed a horse that was asleep in the stables and
dragged it to his camp to eat. Unbeknownst to Bolin, the horse belonged to a
local wizard. The mage gathered his allies and went to confront the
horse-eater. Bolin drew his sword, but a spell from the mages disintegrated it.
Thinking they had already won, the mages began laughing and taunted Bolin. The
barbarian may not have had a weapon, but he still had his scabbard. The mighty
warrior wielded the scabbard like a club and began pummeling the unarmed mages.
Bolin beat eight wizards to death that night, thus earning him the title "Bolin
the Pummeler."

**Properties:** Roll +1 damage die against wizards, mages, and other magical
entities.

## Thievery
### Pickpocket's Glove, weak glove
**Lore:** This elbow-length glove is made of coarse leather and appears to have
been stitched together by an amateur. Set into the palm of the glove is a small
golden coin bearing the seal of some unknown kingdom. Dellehan was a
down-on-his-luck thief. He lacked the grace and subtlety essential to his
trade, and as a result he spent most of his time in jail. When the constable
told him his next slip-up would earn him an appointment with the headsman,
Dellehan swore to himself that he'd never get caught again. For a time,
Dellehan did indeed manage to get away with a few handfuls of coin. Everything
changed when he slipped his hand into a wizard's pockets. He pulled out a
single coin that was unlike anything he'd ever seen&ndash;it bore strange
symbols, almost more like magic runes than a kingdom's official
seal.Unfortunately, the constable spotted Dellehan's crime. Dellehan fled,
gripping the coin tightly in his hand. Dellehan was shocked when the constable
stopped, looked past him, swore under his breath, and ran into another
alley.After some experimenting back at his den, Dellehan found out that the
coin was some sort of invisibility charm. He realized he could use it to his
advantage and become a master thief, scourge of merchants and nobles alike.
Keeping track of such a small object would limit his ability to practice his
craft, so he opted to sew it into a glove. Dellehan set about stitching the
coin into the palm of an old leather glove he liked to wear. But without any
knowledge of magic, Dellehan had no way of knowing that his actions would
forever change the coin's magic. The coin's newly limited magic would now only
apply to his arm.Of course, old habits die hard. Even with a magical glove
aiding his craft, Dellehan was eventually caught and executed. His glove has
been changing hands (so to speak) ever since.

**Properties:** When the wearer firmly presses their fingers into the coin, the
gloved arm becomes invisible. An illusory copy of the arm takes its place.

### Whisper, weak hood
**Lore:** This plain leather hood has subtle etchings around the brim. The hood
hangs over the wearer's face, obscuring it in shadow. For a magic item so
deeply rooted in deception, can anybody be truly certain of its origins?

**Properties:** When the wearer hears someone's voice, they can perfectly
replicate that voice for the next day or so. This effect ends prematurely if
anybody sees the wearer's face.

## Tracking
### Cuervo, the Hunter's Companion, weak bow
**Lore:** This is a simple oaken hunting bow adorned with raven's feathers as
decoration. This bow was named for the raven that followed around a hunter
throughout his time in the wilderness. The bird would scout ahead and return to
alert the hunter to danger or assist in tracking prey. Eventually, the bird
died and the hunter kept some of his feathers as an adornment on the bow.
Despite the loss of his companion, until the end of his days the hunter could
always rely on his friend's spirit to help guide the way.

**Properties:** The bow has 1d6 feathers attached near the handle. The wielder
can pluck one of the feathers to summon Cuervo, a spirit raven. The bird is
extremely intelligent and can perform tasks given to it by the bow's owner.
Cuervo turns back into a feather after about 1 hour abroad. When the last
feather is destroyed, the wielder of the bow gets a last glimpse of the raven
landing on the shoulder of an ethereal figure before they both wander off into
the mists.

### Forager's Hand, weak glove
**Lore:** This thick leather glove is of exceptional quality. A leather strap
along the back of the wrist ensures that it stays on securely. The back of the
glove bears the outline of an apple in thread. This glove was likely used by a
forest-dwelling tribe to make long voyages possible without concern for food.
Hundreds of pounds of fresh fruit could be dehydrated and stored away without
the worry of it rotting over the following months. Any source of running water
meant a veritable feast for the tribesmen, as contact with water would cause
the dehydrated snacks to inflate and become plump and juicy once again.

**Properties:** When the glove comes in contact with fruit, the fruit shrinks
and becomes dehydrated. Fruit dehydrated by the glove will stay fresh
indefinitely, and any contact with water (saliva doesn't count) will cause them
to rehydrate and return to their original forms.

### Wayfinder's Brooch, weak brooch
**Lore:** Nothing about this brooch appearance suggests a deeper power, except
for perhaps the odd coloration of the feathers used in its creation. Several
iridescent feathers are affixed to a ring of entwined fibers, each one
perfectly pristine. Druids often tell the story of Ahnsal and Carwen, two
deities that fell in love but could never be together. Ahnsal was a handsome
winged god of the skies, often depicted with avian features and a crown of
iridescent feathers as wild and untamed as the skies. Carwen was a beautiful
(but wingless) goddess of the forest who captured Ahnsal's heart.Whenever the
two lovers met, they created violent storms that brought untold destruction.
Floods crashed through the forests, winds ripped ancient trees from the ground,
and lightning tore the skies asunder. Seeing that their union could only bring
destruction to Carwen's beloved forest, they agreed to part ways. It is said
that Ahnsal created a pendant that would rain down feathers wherever he flew,
so that Carwen would always know if she stood where he once flew.

**Properties:** If the wearer likes, he leaves behind himself a trail of
magical feathers. If moved, the feathers will magically return to their
original position, carried on mystic winds. The feathers last for a week or so.

## Transformation
### Three-Faced Mirror, powerful mirror
**Lore:** This silver hand mirror is ornately engraved on both sides; one side
bears a frowning mask, while the opposite bears a smiling one.  There doesn't
appear to be an actual mirrored surface, despite its shape. Among the noble
houses of Everstone, no ghost story is known by more or talked about by fewer
than that of Rosetta Walsh. The Walsh family was one of the most influential of
the noble caste of Everstone, and their estate on the edge of town was as much
a home as a tourist attraction. That was, of course, until it caught fire in
the dead of night. In the ensuing blaze, every member of the Walsh family
passed&ndash;except for one: Rosetta Walsh. Rosetta was scarcely over twenty
years old, and until now, had only been a footnote in the Walsh legacy. She was
betrothed to a young man of House Everstone, Rorick. In the aftermath of this
tragedy, it was expected that the marriage would fall through. Rosetta seemed
to take things&ndash;rather well, however, and she insisted the marriage
continue as planned. As heir to the Walsh fortune, she would pay for the
arrangements herself. Over time, Rorick would sense that something had changed
in Rosetta.  She spoke less and less of her dreams, and more of her desires.
Immediate, calculable gains rather than long-term happiness. This wasn't the
Rosetta he knew. On the day of the wedding, when the two were exchanging their
vows, Rorick took Rosetta's hand and asked, "Are you the real Rosetta Walsh?"
Rosetta's face paled, and he knew in an instant that it was an impostor. In a
flash, he drew a small blade from his pocket and ran the woman through. In
front of a shocked audience, Rosetta's young face melted into that of an old
crone, and she died on the church steps.

**Properties:** After turning the object three times, a mirror appears on the
side facing the bearer.  The bearer takes on the physical appearance of
whomever they think about while gazing into the mirror. This does not change
stats or traits&ndash;only the user's appearance.

### Titan Amulet, powerful necklace
**Properties:** The wearer is twice as large as normal.

**Lore:** This ring-shaped amulet is made of a milky blue gemstone. A thin gold
chain loops through the hole in the center. The chain emerging from the front
of the amulet is twice as thick as the chain entering the hole in the back of
it. There have been many star-crossed lovers through history. When a giant and
a human fell in love with each other, it seemed like their love story was
destined to end in tragedy. Rather than bemoaning their fate, the giant
beseeched his kin to forge a magic item that would unite him with his love.
Moved by his passionate plea, an enchanter forged this amulet, which would
increase the woman's size to that of a giant. With this amulet, the giant and
the human woman were able to live a happy life together. The amulet has since
been passed down through the ages and has lost a considerable portion of its
magic.

## Undeath
### Eye of the Reaper, weak monocle
**Lore:** This monocle has a dull gold rim. There's a single hairline crack
that begins at the edge of the lens, and snakes its way inward just before the
center of the glass. Necromancers rarely work together, but once in a blue moon
a group of like-minded necromancers will unite towards a common goal. Keeping
track of everyone's undead minions is a logistical nightmare -- after all, it's
practically impossible to distinguish one animated skeleton from another. Fed
up with constant mix-ups, one necromancer created this eyepiece.

**Properties:** When the possessor views an undead creature through this
monocle, they learn all of the creature's qualities. They may also ask any
question about the undead creature, which the GM must answer honestly.

### Book of Captured Shadows, powerful book
**Lore:** This is a large, spiral bound tome with blank, ash-grey pages. A
bone-feather quill is attached to it. After discovering the bloody aftermath of
a battle between his people and dragon-kin, a soldier stumbled upon a corpse of
a little girl with a sketch book and quill in her hands. The man was overcome
with grief and drew a sketch of the carnage, hoping to forever capture the
tragedy so that future generations would never forget what happened here.
Unfortunately, he didn't notice the young girl's blood on the quill. Ash
settled onto the pages as he drew, infusing his macabre drawing with the rage
and anguish of his slaughtered brethren. The soldier drew as if possessed,
eventually filling the entire book in an endless tableau of carnage. The last
page showed nothing but tortured faces&ndash;some he knew and some unknown. To
his horror, a dark and twisted shadow began to emerge from the pages. A cold,
distant voice rang in his head, "Thank you. Now, we shall seek our vengeance on
those who wronged us." With that, the shadow collapsed into the soldier's
shadow, infusing him with their power. The newly born shadebeast set off to
seek terrible vengeance against those who had wronged it.

**Properties:** If the wielder uses the book and quill to draw the aftermath of
a death, the souls of the unavenged will spill into the page. They will grant
the possessor a fraction of their power (a boost to stats, temporary trait,
knowledge of the enemy, etc. The GM decides what they grant, and how long the
bonuses last.

## Warfare
### Amputator, weak rapier
**Lore:** The long, thin blade of this rapier is criss-crossed with dozens of
knicks and scrapes. The hand guard is simple in its design&ndash;a smooth metal
dome protects the wielder's hands from incoming strikes. The half-elf Sasha
Orellum had something of a dilemma: she was short. That normally wouldn't be
much of a problem, but Sasha had dreams of mastering the art of fencing. She
was a skilled fighter and was incredibly agile, but her short arms put her at a
severe disadvantage against her much taller adversaries. What good is speed and
precision when your opponents can strike you long before your rapier even
reaches their bodies? So, Sasha rethought her strategy. If she couldn't reach
her opponent's chest before getting hit, she'd aim for the next best thing:
their hands. She invented a fighting style that focused entirely on disarming
her foes. She became so good at it that the other fencing students jokingly
called her sword "Amputator" for its ability to disarm other fencers. Sasha
went on to become a grandmaster fencer at her academy, and her famous sword
remained on display for years after her death. The sword was eventually awarded
to an adventurer as part of a job well done. Now, it goes from swordsman to
swordsman, bestowing wielders with a fragment of Sasha's talent.

**Properties:** When you make a Good attack or better with this weapon, disarm
the target.

### Bulwark, weak shield
**Lore:** This tower shield is made mostly from stone and greatly resembles a
castle wall. It seems bigger from behind than it appears from the front. The
Bulwark was created from the wall of a fortress after a young prince claimed
he'd never leave the walls of the keep. The prince, a pacifist, was never
particularly effective on front-line assaults. He did become quite fond of his
fellow squad members however and always did his best to prevent any of them
from coming to harm. After he retired at the end of a long career he passed on
the shield, which was said to carry on some of his will.

**Properties:** Whenever the wielder spends advantage to decrease an attack,
the attack is also decreased against all other targets of the attack.

### Gladius, weak shortsword
**Lore:** This sword is about as average as it gets. The leather grip is
slightly worn but comfortable, the metal of the blade is neither dull nor
shining, and the edge is adequately sharp. This weapon would look perfectly at
home at the side of any rank and file soldier. Originally, nothing about the
Gladius was special. It was just a simple sword crafted by a simple blacksmith.
A soldier took the Gladius to war and used it to kill his enemies. That soldier
died, so the Gladius found itself in the hands of another warrior. That soldier
also used the Gladius to slay enemies before dying in battle. And so it went,
battle after battle after battle. Ten battles became a hundred, and a hundred
battles became a thousand. This blade has taken countless lives and has been
wielded by a near endless line of warriors. Simple though it may be, the
Gladius is one of the most successful and reliable blades in history.

**Properties:** The wielder gains as a temporary trait 1 random combat trait
that the previous owner had. Once the wielder loses the Gladius (it's given
away, lost, stolen, etc), he can no longer benefit from its magic effect again.

### Summer Cloak, weak cloak
**Lore:** This cloak is a thick oilskin smock, with a button-on hood and fleece
lining. The front of the smock has a covered pocket sewn into it and while it
feels normal from the outside, the pocket is always pleasantly warm within. The
pocket has an opening about a foot across and is as deep. Summer Cloaks are one
of the few magic items that are mass produced. Military organizations
(especially those stationed near the frigid north) order Summer Cloaks en masse
from local pyromancers. Commander Darian Blackspire, the lord commander of the
Northsworn Army, once went on record saying that Summer Cloaks are twice as
valuable as a sword. "I'd sooner have my men fight barehanded and warm," he
said, "than watch them freeze to death clutching to a hunk of metal."

**Properties:** The interior of the cloak maintains a pleasantly warm
temperature.

### Thud's Skullcap, powerful helmet
**Lore:** This ancient iron helm is dented, scratched, and rusted. It is
dome-shaped and has two iron bands bolted across it in an X-shaped pattern.
There are two holes in the helm, each about as wide as a thumb. One hole is at
the top of the helmet and the other is above where the wearer's right ear would
be. Nobody knows the history of Thud. All anybody knows about the ill-fated
warrior is that he showed up in a small village one day wearing a full suit of
armor, bleeding from a head wound. He was completely incoherent, but the locals
managed to get the man to a healer. It was there that they discovered that a
shard of some strange, unidentifiable metal had pierced all the way through the
helmet and the man's skull. The healers tried to remove the shard, but they
almost lost their lives&ndash;the man would scream in agony whenever anybody
tried to touch it and he would lash out violently. Since they were unable to
remove the shard, they simply left it in and waited for a moment when the man
would let them operate. That day never came. Somehow, the wound healed around
the metal shard still embedded in his head. The man, whom the locals named Thud
for his tendency to bump into objects, had obviously lost part of his mind from
the injury. He had no memory of his former life, he was a complete idiot, and
he could barely speak more than one word at a time. Fortunately, he was still a
capable warrior. He relentlessly protected the people of that small village
against invaders and he was instrumental in fighting back a goblin invasion...
all with a metal shard sticking out of his brain. Thud eventually died of old
age. The entire village attended the simple-minded warrior's funeral. Nobody
ever learned his real name or where the bizarre metal shard came from, but
everybody from that small village was thankful that they had known Thud.

**Properties:** The wearer has +5 toughness and -3 mind. After the helmet is
removed, the effects gradually wear off over the course of about 1 day.
