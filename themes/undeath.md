# Undeath
## Combat
### Dead Nerves &bull; Passive
You are immune to disease and terror.

When you fall to 0 life, you remain conscious, you can continue to act, and you
don't have to roll to stabilize. This effect lasts for about 10 minutes, or
until you take damage.
 
### Death Curse &bull; Action
*Once each session, describe how you invoke death* &#8594; Gain creative
license to kill a creature within a far distance that isn't significantly more
powerful than you.
 
### Plaguebearer &bull; Passive
When you gain this trait, work with your GM to create a disease and write it on
your character sheet. You can spread this disease by its normal transmission
method or through a damaging attack. Creatures that you personally infect
experience early symptoms immediately, and late symptoms in a matter of seconds
of minutes; roll to determine how soon. You are immune to this disease.
 
### Raise Dead &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you return a dead creature to unlife* &#8594; The target
reanimates as an undead slave that you control. It has the same attributes it
had in life, fully healed. Work with your GM to determine the dire cost (it
will try to break free of your control and betray you, it slowly drains your
life essence, its soul will haunt you upon release, etc).
 
### Undying &bull; Passive
Work with the GM to create a death condition (decapitated, destroyed
phylactery, staked in the heart, etc). Unless you die under those conditions,
gain creative license to reanimate within about 1 day to 1 week (the GM decides
when) with full life. You are temporarily weakened (the GM decides how and for
how long).

If you die and don't have this trait, you can work with your GM to permanently
sacrifice something (memories, your humanity, stats, etc) and immediately gain
this trait.
 
### Vampirism &bull; Passive
Whenever you make an attack that damages a worthy creature, heal one-tenth of
your life.

## Exploration
### Despoiler &bull; Action
*Describe how you spread necrotic energy* &#8594; You cause everything within a
midrange distance to wither, rot, or age 100 years (food rots, iron bars rust,
wooden doors mold and crack, etc). This doesn't affect creatures.
 
### Foul Appetite &bull; Slow Action
When you gain this trait, work with the GM to create a foul appetite (eat
living flesh, drink blood, absorb nightmares, etc). This is now the one and
only biological need you must regularly satisfy. Work with the GM to determine
what happens when you satisfy it (enhanced senses, renewed youth, accelerated
healing, etc), and what happens when you don't satisfy it (crippling pain,
cracked and bloody skin, uncontrollable bloodlust, etc).
 
### Haunt &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you haunt an area* &#8594; Work with the GM to determine how your
essence haunts an area (a haunted house won't let guests leave, a haunted
forest attracts undead spirits, a ship gains an undying ghostly crew, etc). You
can only haunt one area at a time.
 
### Hunt the Living &bull; Passive
When you gain this trait, work with the GM to determine how you can detect and
track the living (smell fear, hear heartbeats, sense nightmares, etc).
 
### Unlife and Unlimb &bull; Passive
You can attach and reattach your body parts. You can control your detached body
parts and sense the world through them (feel with a detached finger, see with a
detached eyeball, crawl with a detached hand, etc). If you ever lose a body
part, you can reattach a similar body part from another creature and it becomes
part of your body (this never affects your attributes).
 
### Wraith Form &bull; Action
*Describe how you become incorporeal* &#8594; You and your equipment become
ethereal, or you return to your normal form.

## Interaction
### Aura of Death &bull; Action
*Describe how you emit a chilling aura* &#8594; You emit an invisible aura of
death out to a midrange distance for about 1 minute. Living creatures feel the
aura as an unsettling, sinking feeling that is deeply disturbing. They gain the
overwhelming desire to leave the aura as quickly as possible unless they have
an extremely good reason to stay.
 
### Audience with the Reaper &bull; Slow Action 
*Describe how you reach out to the realm beyond* &#8594; You contact Death
itself. Death can spare the dying, revive the dead, kill the living, or reveal
information about its dark work&ndash;but always at a price.

### Lay to Rest &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you treat a dead or dying creature with ceremony* &#8594; Write
the name of the creature on your character sheet. At any point, you may cross
the name off your character sheet and invoke the creature to gain their
supernatural aid (increase a roll to do something the creature would be adept
at, recall a fact the creature would know, etc.).
 
### Medium &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you contact dead spirits* &#8594; You draw forth a dead spirit,
who must speak with you. However, it is under no obligation to be helpful. You
can draw forth a specific spirit if you are near something that was important
to it in life.
 
### Possess &bull; Action
*Describe how you possess a corpse or helpless creature that you're touching*
&#8594; You vanish and take control of the target's body. You and the possessed
can hear each other's thoughts, you use the possessed creature's attributes
instead of your own (you retain access to this trait), and you take the same
damage that the possessed body takes. When the possession ends, you reappear in
an adjacent space. The possession ends when it should logically end (you enter
hallowed ground, someone performs an exorcism, you willingly leave the host,
etc).
