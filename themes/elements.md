# Elements
## Combat
### Cataclysm &bull; Action
When you gain this trait, select an element.

*Describe how you invoke elemental chaos* &#8594; Create a powerful,
uncontrollable manifestation of your element within a midrange distance (a lava
geyser erupts, a miniature twister forms, lightning randomly strikes the area,
etc). The GM decides what the manifestation does.
 
### Elemental Soul &bull; Passive
When you gain this trait, choose two:

* **Resistance:** You are immune to fire, lightning, or cold, or you have +2
  block (choose one).
* **Air:** You don't decrease rolls when you hurry.
* **Earth:** You weigh 20 times more and can't be forcibly moved. Roll extra
  damage die (the GM decides how many) if you crush someone.
* **Fire:** Once each combat, at any point, deal melee damage to others in a
  blast centered on you (no attack roll required).
* **Water:** You and allies within a far distance heal twice as much as normal.

### Frostbite &bull; Passive
When you damage a creature, slow it. If it's already slow from this trait, it's
stuck. If it's already stuck from this trait, stun it for 1 round. If it's
already stunned from this trait, roll +3 damage die and it loses all debuffs
from this trait. Resisting.
 
### Immolate &bull; Action
*Describe how you ignite a creature* &#8594; Deal melee or ranged damage and
the target bleeds. This stacks with all bleed effects, including itself.
 
### Lightning Bolt &bull; Action
*Describe how you throw a bolt of lightning* &#8594; Deal ranged damage to a
creature within a close distance. The attack then bounces as many times as you
like to new targets within a close distance. Each time, roll 1 less damage die.

## Exploration
### Control Weather &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you change the weather* &#8594; Name any weather effect that your
region could normally experience at this time of year. That weather effect
gathers over the course of the next hour or so, and then persists for at least
1 day.
 
### Clutch of Earth &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you manipulate gravity* &#8594; Significantly intensify or weaken
gravity in an area that extends out to a midrange distance.
 
### Earth Walk &bull; Passive
You can move through stone, metal, and earth as if they have the consistency of
mud. If you are fully encased in one of these materials, you can breathe
normally and sense your surroundings. You can carry objects with you if you've
held them for about half an hour. You can carry willing living creatures with
you if you prepare as a Slow Action.
 
### Flight &bull; Passive
When you fall, decrease the severity of the fall to the next lower step (from
deadly to dangerous, or from dangerous to safe).

You can fly, maneuvering about as well as a bird in flight. When you gain this
trait, work with your GM to determine weaknesses associated with your flight
(it's extremely exhausting, you need a flat area to safely take off and land,
you are a clumsy flier, etc).
 
### Shape Element &bull; Slow Action
When you gain this trait, select an element.

*Describe how you shape your element* &#8594; Summon or shape up to 1 space of
that element within a close distance. Extending this to a slow action
dramatically increases the range and the number of spaces you can affect.
 
### Tremors &bull; Passive / Slow Action

a far distance. As a slow action, you can concentrate with your ear to the
ground and hear vibrations of very distant things.

around the target.

*Speak a few sentences* &#8594; Your message travels to anyone you like within
a few minutes. That person can then speak a few sentences, and their message
will return to you in a similar fashion.
