# Arcane
## Combat
### Barrier &bull; Action
When you gain this trait, work with your GM to determine a unique feature for
your walls (they're bigger than normal, they reflect projectiles, they deal
damage on touch, etc). 

*Describe how you use defensive magic* &#8594; Within a far distance, create a
wall that is up to a close distance across. Once per session, if a wall could
prevent someone from being harmed, you may use this as an Interrupt.
 
### Counterspell &bull; Interrupt
*Once each combat, at any point, describe how you counterspell* &#8594; A
combatant's roll is automatically the worst possible result, no matter what.
Then, stun the target for 1 turn.
 
### Evoker &bull; Action
*Describe how you create an explosion* &#8594; Deal ranged damage in a blast,
centered at any point of your choosing within mid-range distance.
 
### Force Armor &bull; Passive
If you aren't wearing armor, you have +5 block and your block can't be reduced
or ignored.

### Magic Missile &bull; Passive
You can make ranged attacks which turn corners. Your targets will never benefit
from cover. These attacks have the "ranged" and "accurate" weapon keywords.

### Power Within &bull; Passive
You can use magic to attack without the aid of a wand, staff, book, etc. Your
body counts as a weapon, and your weapons have the ranged keyword for free. 

### Spell Swap &bull; Action
*Describe how you swap magic* &#8594; Bolster. The GM must describe all of the
buffs and debuffs on present combatants. You can move a buff or debuff from one
present combatant to another present combatant. 

## Exploration
### Blink &bull; Move
When you gain this trait, work with your GM to determine limitations (you can
only teleport short distances, you leave something behind, you must have
visited your destination before, etc). 

*Describe how you teleport* &#8594; Teleport to another location.
 
### Cantrips &bull; Action
*Describe how you cast minor magic* &#8594; Achieve a minor magical effect
(inscribe a glowing floating rune on a surface, make a handheld item vanish or
appear, light all candles and torches in a room, etc). When you take this
trait, determine the five minor effects of which you are capable.
 
### Detect Magic &bull; Passive
You can detect and experience magic with your normal senses.
 
### Invisibility &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you render something invisible* &#8594; Turn a creature or object
you're touching invisible. It lasts for about 1 hour, or until the target
attempts a strenuous or complicated action (attack, run, pick a lock, etc). You
can only have 1 invisibility effect active at a time.
 
### Ritual &bull; Passive/Slow Action
Tell the GM an effect you want to achieve through ritual magic (eternally seal
a creature in a tomb, open a portal to another plane, make a magical effect
permanent, etc). The GM must explain everything you have to do in order to
complete the ritual (sacrifice rare items, join with other mages, visit a
certain location, etc). If you perform the ritual and satisfy the requirements,
gain creative license to achieve the effect.
 
### Wizard Eye &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you conjure a magic orb* &#8594; Conjure an eyeball-sized
floating orb, which lasts for about 1 hour. It goes wherever you telepathically
command it to go, but never more than 1 space off the ground. You can see,
hear, and sense through the orb whenever you want.

## Interaction
### Academic Debate &bull; Passive
Increase all rolls you make to engage in diplomacy and debate.
 
### Call Familiar &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you summon a familiar* &#8594; Work with your GM to obtain a very
small creature (imp, frog, raven, etc), or restore your old one if it died. It
has life equal to your toughness, can speak or communicate with you
telepathically, and logically appropriate qualities (a raven flies, a cat
climbs, a frog swims, etc). You can use traits through your familiar, as if you
are standing at its location.
 
### Leading Expert &bull; Passive
When you gain this, select a topic (nature, monsters, nobility, etc). Whenever
you encounter something that relates to that topic, declare a plausible fact
about that topic (this tree sap cures disease, wyverns only hunt at dusk, King
Ramus III was buried near here, etc). The GM must make it true.
 
### Scientific Discovery &bull; Passive
When you uncover obscure information and share your findings with the world,
mark on your character sheet that you are an authority on that subject.
Increase all future rolls you make to understand or remember information about
that topic. People who are interested in that subject will have heard of you
and will be significantly more respectful and helpful to you.
 
### Sleep &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how your magic lulls creatures that are performing relaxing or
mundane activities to sleep* &#8594; Creatures in a blast within a close
distance fall asleep, assuming they are capable of sleeping. Using this trait
doesn't give off any cues (unless you want it to). Resisting.
