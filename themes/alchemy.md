the course of about 1 minute. Once set, the glue irrevocably sticks two things
together.

### Universal Acid &bull; Acid
This acid dissolves up to 5 spaces of material over the course of about 1
minute. If a creature touches it, deal the brewer's damage to them.

### Exotic Reagent &bull; Reagent
Exotic reagents are rare, highly valuable alchemical reagents (the heart of a
demon, bottled cloud, gemstone dust, etc). In general, an adventurer should
come across several exotic reagents over the course of an adventure. When you
come across a strange material, ask the GM if it qualifies as an exotic
reagent. If you successfully harvest it (the GM may require a roll to do so),
write on your character sheet the reagent and a few concepts the GM tells you
that are associated with the reagent (A demon heart relates to hatred and fire,
a bottled cloud relates to sky and air, gemstone dust relates to earth and
beauty, etc).

### Elixir &bull; Potion
Drink this elixir (a simple action) to increase a roll that relates to the
exotic reagent(s) used to make it (for example, a demonheart elixir might let
you increase a roll that relates to hatred, fire, or demons).

### Perfume of Attraction &bull; Perfume
Spritz it over something (an action). For the next day or so, creatures in the
area are inexplicably and powerfully drawn towards the scented object.
Creatures that are close enough to smell the perfumed object gain the desire to
posses it.

### Bottled Pheromones &bull; Perfume
Upon creation of this item, the brewer selects a base instinct (lust, rage,
hunger, fear, etc). When unbottled, pheromones fill the air. Creatures in the
area gradually feel the chosen emotion in increasing intensity. 

### All-cohol &bull; Drug
This alcohol is so powerful that a single sip can make a person completely and
totally drunk within 1 minute (bigger creatures require more to get drunk).
Creatures under the influence of this alcohol tend to forget everything that
happens when they're drunk.

### Neuro-Agent &bull; Drug
Upon creation of this item, the brewer selects the method of taking the drug
(injection, inhalation, ingestion, etc) and then works with the GM to determine
its effects (extreme elation, hyperactivity, the munchies, how long it lasts,
etc). Whoever takes this drug will begin to experience its effects. The drug is
addictive.
