# Beast
## Combat
### Blood Frenzy &bull; Passive
At any point, you can ask "Which of my foes is closest to death?" and the GM
must answer honestly. Roll +1 damage die against that creature until you ask
this question again.
 
### Envelop &bull; Action
*Describe how you envelop an adjacent creature that is your size or smaller*
&#8594; Envelop the target inside of you (it's swallowed, wrapped in your
tentacles, constricted by your snake body, etc). You automatically deal melee
damage to it on your turns (including this first turn). It can't move or attack
others, but it can attack you; it rolls +1 damage die when it does. You can
envelop as many creatures as is logical, and you release enveloped creatures on
your turn.
 
### Gaze of the Gorgon &bull; Action
*Describe how you set your gaze on a creature* &#8594; The target is slow and
bleeds. Absolutely nothing can remove the slow or bleed except breaking line of
sight. If the target is defeated under your gaze, it turns to stone.
 
### Rend &bull; Passive
Your attacks inflict bleed.
 
### Survival Instinct &bull; Passive
You automatically stabilize.

When your life is less than or equal to your toughness, you regenerate 1, have
+5 block, and increase all rolls to escape.
 
### Trample &bull; Action / Move
*Describe how you trample* &#8594; Move in a straight line, moving through
creatures' spaces. Deal melee damage to each creature you move through.

## Exploration
### Burrow &bull; Action
*Describe how you burrow* &#8594; Dig up to a near distance through soil. If
you like, leave a 1-space-sized tunnel behind you.
 
### Cheetah's Swiftness &bull; Passive
You can travel at incredibly high speeds for short periods, far exceeding
normal limitations. Work with your GM to determine how fast you can travel and
how quickly it exhausts you.
 
### Enhanced Senses &bull; Passive
When you gain this trait, work with your GM to select an enhanced natural sense
from the animal kingdom (bat-like echolocation, wolf-like sense of smell,
cat-like sight, etc). You have that sense, and you increase all rolls you make
to use that sense.
 
### Eyes of the Beast &bull; Action
*Describe how you link with an animal* &#8594; You experience the world through
the animal's senses. You can end the link at any point. Linked animals are more
inclined (but not required) to obey your mental commands. 
 
### Spin Web &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you create webbing* &#8594; Produce sticky or non-sticky strands
of web that are strong than tempered steel chains. If sticky, creatures other
than you that touch it are stuck.
 
### Swarm &bull; Action / Slow Action
*Describe how you disperse (Action)* &#8594; Disperse your body into many
individual pieces (a swarm of bees, a pack of rats, a nest of snakes, etc).
While dispersed, you can't take any actions except to move your component
pieces. Losing component pieces may damage or maim you (GM's discretion).

*Describe how you gather (Slow Action)* &#8594; Reconstitute yourself around
one of your component pieces.
 
### Wall Climbing &bull; Passive
You can adhere to any solid surface, including ceilings.

## Interaction
### Awaken Beast &bull; Slow Action

intelligence, and it can now speak. If you haven't provoked it, it will
initially be friendly to you.
 
### Beast Master &bull; Passive
You can communicate with animals.
 
### Pack Member &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you attune to a present animal* &#8594; Select a trait that the
animal could logically have. If the GM agrees, gain it as a temporary trait for
as long as you are in the animal's presence. You can only attune to one
creature at a time.
 
### Play Possum &bull; Action
*Describe how you play dead* &#8594; You appear convincingly injured or dead.
 
### Stampede &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you call out to the feral wilds* &#8594; Native animals begin
acting aggressive. If no animals are present, they begin gathering in the area.
