# Heritage
Note: This theme is still in active development by the Tavern Tales community.
This version is based on a draft compiled by /u/plexsoup and subsequently
modified and expanded to work with the Gauntlet-era rules.

Talk to your GM to decide if you'd like to use traits from this theme in your
game. You may decide to wait until they undergo further playtesting, or tweak
them to better fit your game.

## Combat
### Racial Qualities &bull; Passive
Select three characteristics that describe typical individuals with your
genetic heritage. Each of these characteristics will be a watered down, half
strength version of another trait. Collaborate with your GM to figure out what
that means. Any NPCs who share your heritage will automatically have this
trait.

You must also create one disadvantage, weakness, vulnerability, or undesirable
quality associated with this heritage.

### Folk Hero &bull; Passive
Wherever you're from, you were a folk hero. Describe what exactly you did to
earn you reputation. Once per session, you can invoke your story to greatly
increase a roll related to your original heroism.

### Pa's Ax &bull; Passive
Your weapon is a family heirloom. Anyone outside your family decreases rolls to
attack with it. Once per combat, increase an attack roll. If you attack someone
who a previous holder of this weapon attacked, or someone who previously owned
this weapon, roll to bolster each time you deal damage.

## Exploration
### Long Bloodline &bull; Passive
Your predecessors are long dead, but they still look out for you. Whenever you
describe an ancestor, including their style, appearance and personality, and
what they require to rest in peace, write their name on your character sheet.
At any point, you may cross out their name and describe how they assist you in
your current situation (you recall their teachings, their spirit possesses your
body temporarily, etc). Bolster your next action. You may call on the same
ancestor more than once, but only after doing something to help them rest
peacefully.

### Hero's Journey &bull; Passive
You are important. The prophecies foretold your arrival. Your story will be
retold countless times. Write the following words on your character sheet:
"Call", "Reveal", "Overcome". When you have doubts, cross off "Call" to create
a flashback scene, retroactively describing your initial planning. When things
look simple, cross off "Reveal" to introduce a twist or complication, explain
how you discover the truth and how it shakes your resolve. When things look
bleak, cross off "Overcome" and take a free bolster action; explain how you dig
deep to find your heroic second wind. When you "Reveal", you may reset either
"Call" or "Overcome". When you start a new quest, refresh all your keywords.

### Terrible Burden &bull; Passive
You carry something terrible with you (A cursed object, psychological trauma, a
curse, guilt, etc.). Once per session, you may describe how your burden weighs
on you and decrease your next roll. Once you have done this, you may, at any
time, describe how you rise above your burden and greatly increase a roll.

### What Came Before &bull; Passive
You are somehow linked to someone older than you--like a parent, sibling,
mentor, or old friend. Write "Enemy," "Friend," "Problem," and "Solution," on
your character sheet. You can cross these words off to encounter something your
predecessor left behind, that now falls to you. When you've crossed off all
four, write them again.

### Wasn't Always Like This &bull; Passive
You weren't always an adventurer. You used to do something mundane. Describe
your previous occupation (Baker, Accountant, Carpenter, Blacksmith, etc.) You
have advantage on rolls related to your original occupation.

## Interaction
### Nemesis &bull; Passive
You have a nemesis. Work with the GM to describe them, their traits, and their
motivations. Build them as you would a player character, but they begin at
twice your level. You increase all rolls against them. They increase all rolls
against you. Choose one:

* **Usurper:** Your nemesis has taken what is rightfully yours (a title, an
  artifact, a location, etc.) If you defeat them, reclaim it.
* **Villain:** Your nemesis is widely reviled. You may invoke their name to
  increase any rolls to call for aid.
* **Equal:** Once per session, describe something you learned during a previous
  encounter with your nemesis and increase a roll related to that knowledge.
* **Ghost:** Your nemesis evades you. Whenever you learn something about their
  actions or whereabouts, Bolster.

If you defeat your nemesis, choose a new one, or replace this trait with one of
theirs.
 
### Family Name &bull; Slow Action
*Inform someone of your heritage* &#8594; Choose one:

* **Haunted:** Your family wronged this person in the past. They fear and
  mistrust you.
* **Indebted:** This person owes your family a favor.
* **Grateful:** Your family once helped this person. They like and trust you.
 
### Superstition &bull; Passive
Describe three superstitions your characters knows that cause good or bad luck
and write them on your character sheet (Breaking mirrors is bad luck, throwing
coins in fountains is good luck, etc.). Bolster when you would incur good luck.
If you would incur bad luck, an enemy bolsters.
