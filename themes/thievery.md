# Thievery
## Combat
### Duck &bull; Passive
Whenever an attack against you misses, you can have that attack automatically
hit another creature that it logically could have struck.
 
### Mark for Death &bull; Quick Action
*Describe how you set up an enemy for defeat* &#8594; Once per turn, select a
visible enemy. Everyone rolls +1 damage die against that target this combat.
 
### Murder &bull; Passive
Whenever you spend advantage on an attack, roll +1 damage die.
 
### Sneak Attack &bull; Passive
When you successfully attack an unsuspecting victim, the target can't speak for
about 1 minute and you choose one:

* **Backstab:** Roll +2 damage die.
* **Knife to the Throat:** Don't deal damage and hold the target. If it would
  logically fear your threat, the target obeys your commands while you maintain
  the hold. When you end the hold, you can damage the target.
* **Sap:** If logical, knock the target unconscious instead of dealing damage.

### Tumble &bull; Interrupt
Once each combat, at any point, end all slow, immobilize, and hold effects on
you. Then, make a free movement. If this movement makes you an ineligible
target for an incoming attack, that attack misses you.

## Exploration
### Another Way In &bull; Passive
When you fall, lower the severity from deadly to dangerous, or from dangerous
to safe.Increase all rolls you make to infiltrate secure locations, climb, and
balance.
 
### Case the Joint &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you observe a location* &#8594; The GM must honestly answer up to
3 of your questions about the location's defenses and secrets (what the guards'
patrol routes are, if there are any secret entrances, where traps are located,
etc).
 
### Deft Fingers &bull; Passive
Increase all rolls you make to pick locks, disarm traps, pick pockets, and
perform sleight of hand.
 
### Escape &bull; Action
Once each session, gain creative license to escape (pull a lever to reveal a
hidden escape tunnel, vanish in a cloud of smoke, step into a crowd and
disappear, etc).
 
### Lurker &bull; Passive
Increase all rolls you make to sneak and hide. Others can't track you or those
who travel with you.
 
### The Perfect Crime &bull; Passive
Whenever you commit a crime or dirty deed, choose one:

* **No Trace:** Unless you're caught red-handed, you leave behind no useful
  evidence.
* **Scapegoat:** You convincingly frame someone else for the crime.
* **Time to Act:** Authorities are extra slow to arrive on the scene.

### Vanish &bull; Passive
If nobody has seen you for several minutes and you are free to travel (you
aren't tied up or locked away), announce that you vanish. Nobody knows where
you are (including the GM), so you skip your turns. At any point, you can
emerge from any area that you logically could have reached.

## Interaction
### Friends in Low Places &bull; Slow Action
*Roleplay pulling strings with shady individuals* &#8594; Select one of the
following: a lookout, a thug, a forger, a spy, or a thief. You come in contact
with someone whose skills match the description, and will freely help you
commit a crime.
 
### Hustle &bull; Passive
Three times each session, name someone and ask the GM one of the following
questions about them. The GM must answer honestly.

* **Bribe:** Will they accept a bribe, and how much do they want?
* **Blackmail:** Where can I find evidence of their dirtiest secret?
* **Extortion:** What will they do if I threaten their well-being?

community. The GM secretly selects one and makes it true.
 
### Safe House &bull; Passive
You know the location of all safe houses, which are common criminal havens that
are well hidden or disguised as legitimate establishments. They are considered
neutral ground, and they have resources for criminals (black market wares,
thugs for hire, smuggler's tunnel out of the city, etc). You and your present
allies can safely access these safe houses.
 
### Second Identity &bull; Passive
When you gain this trait, work with the GM to develop a complete second
identity (name, friends, contacts, paperwork, a home, a job, etc).
 
### Silver Tongue &bull; Passive
Increase all rolls you make to lie, trick, and deceive.
 
### Sudden but Inevitable Betrayal &bull; Action
*Once each session, describe how you signal a creature within a far distance
that isn't significantly more powerful than you* &#8594; The target has
secretly been working for you all along!
