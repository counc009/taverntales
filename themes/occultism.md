# Occultism
## Combat
### Blood Sacrifice &bull; Interrupt
Once each round, at any point, you can take one-tenth damage (absolutely
nothing can prevent this damage) and Bolster.
 
### Hex &bull; Action
*Describe how you hex someone* &#8594; Hex a creature within a close distance
with bad luck. Whenever it attempts a combat action, something bad occurs in
addition to its normal action regardless of how well it rolls (the GM decides
what).
 
### Pound of Flesh &bull; Interrupt
At any point, write on your character sheet all of the effects of a single
attack made against you. For the next 5 minutes or so, you can't write down new
attacks in this way and you can cross off the attack to inflict identical
effects against a creature within a midrange distance.
 
### Soul Barter &bull; Passive
When you see a creature die, you can send its soul to your patron and choose
one of the options below. The soul takes several minutes to arrive. Your patron
can only hold 1 soul at a time.

* **Barter:** Your patron holds the soul and contacts you to negotiate its
  release. If you meet agreeable terms, the deceased returns to life in the
  next day or so indebted to your patron; otherwise, it dies normally. If you
  die, you can similarly negotiate for your own life.
* **Offer:** Your patron does whatever it pleases with the soul. This improves
  your patron's opinions of you.
* **Sacrifice:** Write the creature's name on your character sheet. At any
  point, cross it off to gain a fraction of the deceased's power (a boost to a
  stat, a temporary trait, a physical feature, etc).
 
### Summon Servant &bull; Action
When you gain this trait, work with your GM to determine what types of
creatures you can summon, and restrictions (you can only have 1 at a time, the
process is draining, they're rebellious, etc).

*Describe how you summon a minion* &#8594; Summon a creature that is your level
or lower. It will do whatever it pleases, but it will obey you if your orders
coincide with its instincts.
 
### Unspeakable Horror &bull; Action
*Describe how you horrify a creature* &#8594; Bolster. Terrify a creature
within a close distance. Resisting.

## Exploration
### Circle of Binding &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you create a binding circle* &#8594; Walk in a circle that is no
more than a far distance across. When you are finished, you create an
impervious barrier that no creature can pass or circumvent. Work with your GM
to determine what causes the prison to end (time passes, a certain item is
brought before the prison, an event occurs, etc).
 
### Conjuration &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you complete a conjuring ritual* &#8594; You separate part of
your or a willing creature's soul into an object (an infernal contract, a
crystallized fragment of your soul, a vial of your blood, etc). The possessor
can expend it as a simple action to summon that person to their location.
 
### Defile &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you imbue a feature of the terrain that you are touching with
your patron's power* &#8594; So long as the feature of the terrain remains
intact, corruption gradually spreads outward (the GM decides how quickly). Your
patron changes the surrounding area to better suit its tastes (a demon makes it
rain ash and fire, a fey queen makes an area dangerously overgrown and
enchanted, an entity from beyond fills the area with shadow and madness).
Creatures in the area increase rolls they make to take advantage of the
modified terrain.

### Give and Take &bull; Interrupt
At any point, you may invoke Give to greatly increase any roll, even if it
isn't your own. At any point after that, the GM may invoke Take to greatly
increase an enemy's role, or greatly decrease one of yours. You may not invoke
Give again until the GM has invoked Take.
 
### Portal &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you create a portal* &#8594; You create a portal to your patron's
home, allowing travelers to freely pass between realms. Anybody near the portal
can directly contact your patron, and your patron can manifest through the
portal if the conditions are right.
 
### Trial by Fire &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you leave your plane* &#8594; You enter the border between
realms, taking willing travelers with you. This allows you to travel very long
distances in a short amount of time; however, you may expose yourself to the
dangers of planar travel.
 
## Interaction
### Binding Contract &bull; Passive
If you like, contracts and agreements that you sign, notarize, or mediate are
fully binding. Their terms are magically enforced (If someone signs a contract
saying they will never speak of an event, then they forever lose the ability to
speak of it). You must mention that the terms are fully binding (mentioning it
in barely readable fine text is acceptable).
 
### Blissful Agony &bull; Action
*Describe how you inflict physical sensations* &#8594; Force a creature you are
touching to experience any physical sensation you want. This doesn't deal
damage.
 
### Blood Link &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you create a blood link* &#8594; You must destroy something that
is important to someone (a vial of their blood, their relative, their prized
possession, etc). Then, work with your GM to temporarily gain otherworldly
power over them (force them to experience pain, temporarily steal some of their
power, paralyze them, etc).
 
### Dark Bargain &bull; Quick Action
At any point, gain creative license to temporarily channel your patron's power
(gain one of your patron's traits as a temporary trait, call your patron to
this plane, learn the answer to any question, etc). However, this power comes
at a price (you permanently change to become more like your patron, you must
fulfill a favor, you must make a sacrifice, etc). The more power you channel,
the greater the price.
 
### Dark Visions &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you manipulate someone* &#8594; Choose one option for a creature
that you're speaking with:

* **Dark Desires:** Learn their darkest, most twisted desire.
* **Twisted Thoughts:** Make the target permanently insane (they gain a phobia,
  they hear voices, they hallucinate, etc).

### Devious &bull; Passive
Increase all rolls you make to negotiate, exploit the law, and corrupt.

### Effigy &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you use identifying pieces of a creature (Blood, hair, nail
clippings etc.) to create a small representation of them* &#8594; The creature
and doll are linked. Things you do to the doll affect the creature (e.g. giving
the doll coins may lead the target to win or find treasure, twisting its leg
may cause the target break theirs, jerking it upward quickly may give the
target advantage on jumps, etc.). You may use the doll three times before
you'll require additional materials and time to reinstate the magic link.

## Patron Creation Guidlines
In Tavern Tales, you get to decide what sort of patron you follow. You can
create a patron for your character to follow by using these patron creation
guidelines. However, check with your GM first. Your GM may want to use a unique
setting where the patrons are already established. In that case, you may be
able to work with your GM to modify the established patrons to suit your
tastes.
 
### Step 1: Write a Description
First, write a basic description of who your patron is and what it seeks. Is
your patron a demon from hell? Is she a fey queen who delights in tormenting
mortals? Is it a dark monster that dwells at the bottom of the ocean? Be
creative as you come up with the origin of your patron.
 
### Step 2: Determine Your Patron's Stats
The biggest difference between patrons and gods (from the Faith theme) is that
patrons are much more involved with the world. Gods are cosmic entities who
work in subtle and mysterious ways. They have millions of worshipers and rarely
speak to any of them.

Patrons are less powerful than gods, but they make up for it by being more
involved in the lives of mortals. Because patrons have fewer followers, they
can afford to interact with each individual follower. When you call out to your
patron, your patron will probably answer you.
 
As a result, there might be a situation where you encounter your patron
face-to-face. Work with your GM to stat out your patron. In addition, all
patrons are immortal in one way or another. Killing your patron may get you out
of a deal you made with them, but sooner or later your patron will be back.
 
### Step 3: Determine Your Patron's Personality
You have some control over how your patron acts and behaves. Give your patron
2-4 instincts (corrupt the innocent, spread nightmares, destroy beautiful
things, etc). However, for every personality characteristic you give your
patron, the GM can give it an instinct as well.
 
Expect to disagree with your patron, even if you design your patron so that its
motivations and personality coincide with your own. Patrons treat their
followers like pawns or playthings, forcing them to make sacrifices or perform
favors in exchange for power.

### Is Your Patron Evil?
The Occultism theme is perfect for morally ambiguous characters who want to
serve dark entities. However, you are under no obligation to make your patron
evil. It's entirely up to you to decide what your patron is like as long as you
and your patron disagree from time to time. For example, you may want your
patron to be a benevolent angel who spreads happiness throughout the world.
Perhaps your angel patron wants you to sacrifice your health and happiness to
serve others, or perhaps your angel demands that you purify yourself through
self-mutilation whenever you do something sinful.
