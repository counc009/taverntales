# Faith
## Combat
### Bless &bull; Action
*Describe how you offer a blessing* &#8594; Bolster. For about 5 minutes, a
creature within a close distance starts its turns with soak equal to one-tenth
of its maximum life. You can only have one Bless active at a time. You may not
bless someone again until the current blessing wears off.
 
### Channel Divinity &bull; Action
*At any point, describe how you channel divine power* &#8594; You are immune to
all damage and debuffs (including pre-existing ones) for as long as your deity
deems fit. Resisting.
 
### Lay on Hands &bull; Action
*Describe how you heal* &#8594; Heal a creature you're touching for half of its
life and remove all of its diseases. Resisting.
 
### Purity &bull; Passive
You are immune to terrify, disease, and blind. Once every 5 minutes or so, at
any point, stabilize and remove all debuffs from yourself or a visible ally.
 
### Resurrect &bull; Slow Action
*Roleplay praying to your deity* &#8594; Name a deceased creature. You gain a
vision of a quest. If that quest is completed, the deceased creature returns to
life.
 
### Smite &bull; Action
*Describe how you invoke your deity's wrath* &#8594; Blind, terrify, and deal
melee or ranged damage to all creatures within a midrange distance that your
deity despises. Resisting.

## Exploration
### Consecrate &bull; Slow Action
*Describe a holy ritual* &#8594; Create a permanent shrine to your deity (read
more about shrines below).
 
### Divine Favor &bull; Passive
Whenever the GM agrees that you fulfilled your deity's dogma in a meaningful
way, write on your character sheet that you are blessed. At any point, cross
off a blessing to gain creative license to have your deity influence or
manifest one of its domains (domain over thunder lets you summon a powerful
storm, domain over hate lets you instill a deep hatred in someone, domain over
secrets lets you learn a dark secret, etc).
 
### Path of the Righteous &bull; Passive
Once each session, announce that you walk a righteous path. All shadows,
temptations, and tricks (metaphorical or literal) recede to reveal the true
path to fulfilling your quest.
 
### Pray for Guidance &bull; Slow Action
*Roleplay a prayer to your deity* &#8594; You receive guidance from your deity
about your current situation (where to go and how to get there, a vague clue of
what to do, assurances that your deity favors your current path, etc).
 
### Sanctuary &bull; Passive
At any point, you can have the GM tell you the exact location of your deity's
holy sites in the area (temples, shrines, sacred lands, etc), and how best to
reach them. You are always welcome at these holy sites. If there are no such
holy sites, gain creative license to declare one such holy site exists in the
area.
 
### Scry &bull; Slow Action
When you gain this trait, work with your GM to determine limitations (limited
range, you must be on holy ground, you need a scrying pool, etc). 

*Describe how you scry* &#8594; Remotely view a distant area as if you were
standing there.
 
### Sphere of Influence &bull; Passive
At the start of each session, write 3 of your deity's domains on your character
sheet (losing leftover ones in the process). At any point, cross out one of
those domains to increase a roll that relates to it.

## Interaction
### Avatar &bull; Quick Action
At any point, gain creative license to become the physical incarnation of your
deity or its domains, or return to your normal appearance. This affects your
appearance, not your statistics.
 
### Confession &bull; Passive
Whenever a creature confesses its sins to you, choose one:

* **Atonement:** Choose a quest of atonement, which becomes the creature's
  foremost goal in life.
* **Bear the Burden:** All animosity against the sinner transfers to you, as if
  you were the person who sinned.
* **Jurisdiction:** The government loses the authority to prosecute the sinner,
  and your church gains that right.
 
### Divine Authority &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you channel divine authority* &#8594; Others temporarily regard
you as a legal authority, and they regard your actions as legal as long as you
act within your deity's dogma and don't commit heinous acts.
 
### Inquisition &bull; Slow Action
*Roleplay an interrogation* &#8594; The person you interrogate admits its sins.
 
### Proselytize &bull; Slow Action
*Roleplaying preaching dogma* &#8594; Listeners permanently gain a belief of
your choice associated with your deity's dogma.
 
### Quote Scripture &bull; Passive
When you roll to socialize, increase the roll if you quote scripture that fits
your deity's dogma (you can and should invent verses, hymns, and prayers for
this purpose).

### Zone of Honesty &bull; Action
*Once per session, describe how you sanctify the area within a close distance*
&#8594; No one within that space can lie. The effect fades after a few minutes.

## Guidelines for Deity Creation
You can work with your GM to create a god, goddess, or pantheon for your
character to worship. Alternatively, your GM might want you to select a
pre-established deity. Whatever the case, work together to find a mutually
agreeable solution. Consider discussing the following with your GM:

* **Identity:** Who is your deity? What is your deity like?
* **Domain:** What does your deity hold domain over (time, death, plants, etc)?
  Deities typically have 3-5 domains.
* **Dogma:** How does your deity expect followers to behave?
* **Symbol:** What symbols represent your deity?
* **Heretics:** Whom does your deity despise?
* **Religion:** What are some organizations, rituals, and traditions associated
  with your deity?
* **Shrines:** What do your deity's shrines look like, and where can they be
  found?

## Shrines
A shrine is a structure that allows a deity or group of deities to exert divine
power into the mortal world. Deities bless those who perform sacred acts before
shrines, and curse those who perform profane acts before shrines. It's up to
the GM to decide how much power deities can exert through their shrines, and
under what conditions. Here are a few examples:

* A cultist sacrifices a weeping victim at the Blood Shrine. The victim
  reanimates as an undead servant under the cultist's command.
* A scholar gifts a rare tome to the Lectern of Knowledge. In return, the
  Goddess of Knowledge answers one of the scholar's questions.
* Guards interrogate a thief before the Obelisk of Truth. The thief dares to
  lie in his presence, so his tongue ignites in flame.
* A peasant steals from the collection plate at the Church of Winter. Her home
  becomes chilly, no matter how warm it is outside.
