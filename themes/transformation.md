# Transformation
## Combat
### Clone &bull; Action
*Describe how you create a clone* &#8594; You create a clone of yourself, which
you control. You and your clone share actions, damage, buffs, and limited-use
traits; however, you each have separate move actions and simple actions. You
and your clone can't create other clones. You can touch your clone to safely
terminate it.
 
### Mimicry &bull; Passive
Whenever you see a creature use a trait, you can lose your current mimicked
trait and gain that trait as a temporary trait for about 1 hour. Each trait you
mimic is resisting (you need a full night's rest before you can copy that trait
again).

### Mutation &bull; Action / Quick Action
*Describe how you sprout a new limb or appendage (chitinous plates, quills, a
third arm, etc.)* &#8594; Your new appendage counts as a weapon with two
keywords. You may use it to attack as a quick action. It will fall off, be
reabsorbed into your body, or become otherwise unusable once you attack with
it, or after about half an hour has passed, whichever comes first. You can
safely sustain three of these at a time. After that, creating them is risky (it
may damage you, inflict bleed, stun you, slow you, etc.).
 
### Regeneration &bull; Passive
You regenerate every 10 seconds or so (typically once per combat round).

### Shapeshift &bull; Action
When you gain this trait, work with the GM to create an alternate form with
equal strengths (you are huge and powerful, you deal extra damage, you quickly
heal wounds, etc) and weaknesses (you can't control when you transform, you
become feral, the form drains your strength, etc). Write the form on your
character sheet.

*Describe how you change forms* &#8594; Bolster. You transform into your
alternate form, or back to your original form.

## Exploration
### Chameleon Skin &bull; Action
*Describe how you change colors* &#8594; You blend into your surroundings. If
you remain perfectly motionless, you are effectively invisible.
 
### Clay Body &bull; Passive
Your body is malleable (bend your body like rubber, reach or attack others
within a close distance, squeeze through a keyhole, etc).
 
### Grow / Shrink &bull; Action
*Describe how you grow or shrink* &#8594; Increase or decrease your size by up
to 2 steps from your original size. Doesn't stack.
 
### Perfect Replica &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you change an object's appearance* &#8594; Perfectly replicate
the appearance of anything (forge a signature, fake a magic item, disguise a
door as part of the wall, etc).
 
### Shape Flesh &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you transform into an object* &#8594; You transform into an
inanimate object, or back into your original form. While you are an object, you
retain your senses and you can't act.
 
### Transmute &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you change the physical makeup of an object* &#8594; Choose one:

* Change a property of 1 space of material (it becomes considerably tougher, it
  becomes transparent, it doubles or halves in size, etc).
* Change 1 space of material into a different, similar material (sand into
  stone, coal into oil, wood into paper, etc).

## Interaction
### A Thousand Masks &bull; Slow Action
When you gain this trait, work with the GM to determine restrictions (you can't
use it on others, you can't change gender, you can't mimic specific
individuals, etc).

*Describe how you transform someone you're touching* &#8594; You change the
target's appearance however you like, which lasts for the next day or so. This
change is only cosmetic.
 
### Change of Heart &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you convince somebody to change their outlook* &#8594; Reverse an
aspect of the target's personality for several hours (a selfless person becomes
selfish, a cruel person becomes benevolent, an untrusting person becomes
trusting, etc).
 
### Impersonator &bull; Passive
Increase all rolls you make to mimic, forge, and impersonate.
 
### Polymorph &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you transform a defeated or willing creature that you are
touching* &#8594; Change the target into any other creature you want. The new
form can't be stronger than the old form (you can turn a dragon into a
squirrel, but not a squirrel into a dragon). If used on a player, they rechoose
all stats and traits, ignoring retraining restrictions. Creatures can be
polymorphed only once, ever.
 
### The Curse &bull; Passive
When you gain this trait, work with the GM to determine how your curse spreads
to make others more like you (your blood parasites turn people into zombies,
your infectious bite turns people into werewolves at the next full moon, you
can inscribe a tattoo that turns someone's flesh to stone, etc). When you
spread your curse to a suitable target, it replaces one of its traits with The
Curse and begins to transform. Afterward, the target's disposition towards you
greatly improves.
 
### Transcendent Voice &bull; Passive
You can speak as loud as thunder.You can perfectly replicate any sound that
you've heard before, including volume.
