count), write that creature's name on your list. Increase all rolls you make to
achieve horrible revenge against creatures on your list. You can have up to 3

dead.

## Exploration

  you don't own, and a relevant fact about it.

  before.
 
### King of Your Domain &bull; Passive

### Lair &bull; Slow Action
*Describe how you claim your lair* &#8594; A piece of territory that you
control becomes your lair. Gain creative license to slowly change the terrain
and features of the lair (create web-strewn paths, clinging ice, pools of
magma, etc). At any point, you can ask if someone is trespassing in your lair,
and the GM must answer honestly.
 
### Territorial &bull; Passive
When you are in another creature's territory, you can ask 3 questions about the
territory and its owner. The GM must answer honestly. At any point, you can

### Glory and Splendor &bull; Passive
When you gain this trait, work with your GM to determine your social leverage
(your family name is widely recognized and respected, you are a celebrity,

creatures are significantly more likely to try to appease you.
 
### Pawns and Playthings &bull; Action

creature could be useful to you.  Pick one; you gain significant insight of how
to gain that creature's goods or services.

they can answer it, increase all rolls you make to persuade, advise, or
manipulate them.  They may roll once per day to solve it on their own, and gain
additional rolls by seeking outside help (researching at a library, asking an
elder or oracle, telling their friends and family, etc.)
 
### To the Victor &bull; Passive
When you defeat a creature (physically or socially), select something that your
foe possesses (followers, territory, respect, etc). It is now lawfully yours.
